      <h2 id="ubiquitous-connectivity"><a href="#ubiquitous-connectivity"
      class="anchor">§</a>Ubiquitous Connectivity</h2>

      <p>One of the most transformative technology trends of the past decade is
      the availability and growing expectation of ubiquitous connectivity.
      Whether it is for checking email, carrying a voice conversation, web
      browsing, or myriad other use cases, we now expect to be able to access
      these online services regardless of location, time, or circumstance: on
      the run, while standing in line, at the office, on a subway, while in
      flight, and everywhere in between. Today, we are still often forced to be
      proactive about finding connectivity (e.g., looking for a nearby WiFi
      hotspot) but without a doubt, the future is about ubiquitous connectivity
      where access to the Internet is omnipresent.

      <p>Wireless networks are at the epicenter of this trend. At its broadest,
      a wireless network refers to any network not connected by cables, which
      is what enables the desired convenience and mobility for the user. Not
      surprisingly, given the myriad different use cases and applications, we
      should also expect to see dozens of different wireless technologies to
      meet the needs, each with its own performance characteristics and each
      optimized for a specific task and context. Today, we already have over a
      dozen widespread wireless technologies in use: WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee,
      NFC, WiMAX, LTE, HSPA, EV-DO, earlier 3G standards, satellite services,
      and more.

      <p>As such, given the diversity, it is not wise to make sweeping
      generalizations about performance of wireless networks. However, the good
      news is that most wireless technologies operate on common principles,
      have common trade-offs, and are subject to common performance criteria
      and constraints. Once we uncover and understand these fundamental
      principles of wireless performance, most of the other pieces will begin
      to automatically fall into place.

      <p>Further, while the mechanics of data delivery via radio communication
      are fundamentally different from the tethered world, the outcome as
      experienced by the user is, or should be, all the same—same performance,
      same results. In the long run all applications are and will be delivered
      over wireless networks; it just may be the case that some will be
      accessed more frequently over wireless than others. There is no such
      thing as a <em>wired application</em>, and there is zero demand for such
      a distinction.

      <p>All applications should perform well regardless of underlying
      connectivity. As a user, you should not care about the underlying
      technology in use, but as developers we must think ahead and architect
      our applications to anticipate the differences between the different
      types of networks. And the good news is every optimization that we apply
      for wireless networks will translate to a better experience in all other
      contexts. Let’s dive in.

      <h2 id="types-of-wireless-networks"><a href="#types-of-wireless-networks"
      class="anchor">§</a>Types of Wireless Networks</h2>

      <p>A network is a group of devices connected to one another. In the case
      of wireless networks, radio communication is usually the medium of
      choice. However, even within the radio-powered subset, there are dozens
      of different technologies designed for use at different scales,
      topologies, and for dramatically different use cases. One way to
      illustrate this difference is to partition the use cases based on their
      "geographic range":

      <figure id="types-of-wireless-networks-table">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Type

          <span class="label">Table 5-1.</span> Types of wireless networks

      </figure>

      <p>The preceding classification is neither complete nor entirely
      accurate. Many technologies and standards start within a specific use
      case, such as Bluetooth for PAN applications and cable replacement, and
      with time acquire more capabilities, reach, and throughput. In fact, the
      latest drafts of Bluetooth now provide seamless interoperability with
      802.11 (WiFi) for high-bandwidth use cases. Similarly, technologies such
      as WiMAX have their origins as fixed-wireless solutions, but with time
      acquired additional mobility capabilities, making them a viable
      alternative to other WAN and cellular technologies.

      <p>The point of the classification is not to partition each technology
      into a separate bin, but to highlight the high-level differences within
      each use case. Some devices have access to a continuous power source;
      others must optimize their battery life at all costs. Some require
      Gbit/s+ data rates; others are built to transfer tens or hundreds of
      bytes of data (e.g., NFC). Some applications require always-on
      connectivity, while others are delay and latency tolerant. These and a
      large number of other criteria are what determine the original
      characteristics of each type of network. However, once in place, each
      standard continues to evolve: better battery capacities, faster
      processors, improved modulation algorithms, and other advancements
      continue to extend the use cases and performance of each wireless
      standard.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-zZtks0Sn">
        <p>Your next application may be delivered over a mobile network, but it
        may also rely on NFC for payments, Bluetooth for P2P communication via
        WebRTC, and WiFi for HD streaming. It is not a question of picking, or
        betting on, just one wireless standard!

      <p>Each and every type of wireless technology has its own set of
      constraints and limitations. However, regardless of the specific wireless
      technology in use, all communication methods have a maximum channel
      capacity, which is determined by the same underlying principles. In fact,
      Claude E. Shannon gave us an exact mathematical model (<a data-type=
      "xref" href="#channel-speed">Channel capacity is the maximum information
      rate</a>) to determine channel capacity, regardless of the technology in
      use.

      <figure id="channel-speed" data-type="equation">
        <h5>Channel capacity is the maximum information rate</h5>
        <img src="/assets/equations/cfa8855d073e50488c96c187112772ea.svg"
        class="equation">
      </figure>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><code>C</code> is the channel capacity and is measured in bits per
          second.

        <li>
          <p><code>BW</code> is the available bandwidth, and is measured in
          hertz.

        <li>
          <p><code>S</code> is signal and <code>N</code> is noise, and they are
          measured in watts.
        </ul>

      <p>Although somewhat simplified, the previous formula captures all the
      essential insights we need to understand the performance of most wireless
      networks. Regardless of the name, acronym, or the revision number of the
      specification, the two fundamental constraints on achievable data rates
      are the amount of available bandwidth and the signal power between the
      receiver and the sender.

      <section>
        <h3 id="bandwidth"><a href="#bandwidth" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Bandwidth</h3>

        <p>Unlike the tethered world, where a dedicated wire can be run between
        each network peer, radio communication by its very nature uses a shared
        medium: radio waves, or if you prefer, electromagnetic radiation. Both
        the sender and receiver must agree up-front on the specific frequency
        range over which the communication will occur; a well-defined range
        allows seamless interoperability between devices. For example, the
        802.11b and 802.11g standards both use the 2.4–2.5 GHz band across all
        WiFi devices.

        <p>Who determines the frequency range and its allocation? In short,
        local government (<a data-type="xref" href=
        "#ism-spectrum">Figure&nbsp;5-1</a>). In the United States, this
        process is governed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In
        fact, due to different government regulations, some wireless
        technologies may work in one part of the world, but not in others.
        Different countries may, and often do, assign different spectrum ranges
        to the same wireless technology.

        <p>Politics aside, besides having a common band for interoperability,
        the most important performance factor is the size of the assigned
        frequency range. As Shannon’s model shows, the overall channel bitrate
        is directly proportional to the assigned range. Hence, all else being
        equal, a doubling in available frequency range will double the data
        rate—e.g., going from 20 to 40 MHz of bandwidth can double the channel
        data rate, which is exactly how 802.11n is improving its performance
        over earlier WiFi standards!

        <p>Finally, it is also worth noting that not all frequency ranges offer
        the same performance. Low-frequency signals travel farther and cover
        large areas (macrocells), but at the cost of requiring larger antennas
        and having more clients competing for access. On the other hand,
        high-frequency signals can transfer more data but won’t travel as far,
        resulting in smaller coverage areas (microcells) and a requirement for
        more infrastructure.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-WWtos9sYTm">
          <p>Certain frequency ranges are more valuable than others for some
          applications. Broadcast-only applications (e.g., broadcast radio) are
          well suited for low-frequency ranges. On the other hand, two-way
          communication benefits from use of smaller cells, which provide
          higher bandwidth and less competition.

          class="anchor">§</a>A Brief History of Worldwide Spectrum Allocation
          and Regulation</h4>

          <p>If you spend any time in the world of wireless communication, you
          will inevitably stumble into numerous debates on the state and merits
          of current spectrum allocation and regulation processes. But what is
          the history?

          <p>In the early days of radio, anyone could use any frequency range
          for whatever purpose she desired. All of that changed when the Radio
          Act of 1912 was signed into law within the United States and mandated
          licensed use of the radio spectrum. The original bill was in part
          motivated by the investigation into the sinking of the Titanic. Some
          speculate that the disaster could have been averted, or more lives
          could have been saved, if proper frequencies were monitored by all
          nearby vessels. Regardless, this new law set a precedent for
          international and federal legislation of wireless communication.
          Other countries followed.

          <p>A few decades later, the Communications Act of 1934 created the
          Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the FCC has been
          responsible for managing the spectrum allocation within the U.S ever
          since, effectively "zoning" it by subdividing into ever-smaller
          parcels designed for exclusive use.

          <p>A good example of the different allocations are the "industrial,
          scientific, and medical" (ISM) radio bands, which were first
          established at the International Telecommunications Conference in
          1947, and as the name implies, were reserved internationally. Both
          the 2.4–2.5 GHz (100 MHz) and 5.725–5.875 GHz (150 MHz) bands, which
          power much of our modern wireless communication (e.g., WiFi) are part
          of the ISM band. Further, both of these ISM bands are also considered
          "unlicensed spectrum," which allow anyone to operate a wireless
          network—for commercial or private use—in these bands as long as the
          hardware used respects specified technical requirements (e.g.,
          transmit power).

          <p>Finally, due to the rising demand in wireless communication, many
          governments have begun to hold "spectrum auctions," where a license
          is sold to transmit signals over the specific bands. While examples
          abound, the 700 MHz FCC auction, which took place in 2008, is a good
          illustration: the 698–806 MHz range within the U.S. was auctioned off
          for a total of $19.592 billion to over a dozen different bidders (the
          range was subdivided into blocks). Yes, that is billion with a "b."

          <p>Bandwidth is a scarce and expensive commodity. Whether the current
          allocation process is fair is a subject on which much ink has been
          spilled and many books have been published. Looking forward, there is
          one thing we can be sure of: it will continue to be a highly
          contested area of discussion.
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h3 id="signal-power"><a href="#signal-power" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Signal Power</h3>

        <p>Besides bandwidth, the second fundamental limiting factor in all
        wireless communication is the signal power between the sender and
        receiver, also known as the signal-power-to-noise-power, S/N ratio, or
        SNR. In essence, it is a measure that compares the level of desired
        signal to the level of background noise and interference. The larger
        the amount of background noise, the stronger the signal has to be to
        carry the information.

        <p>By its very nature, all radio communication is done over a shared
        medium, which means that other devices may generate unwanted
        interference. For example, a microwave oven operating at 2.5 GHz may
        overlap with the frequency range used by WiFi, creating cross-standard
        interference. However, other WiFi devices, such as your neighbors’ WiFi
        access point, and even your coworker’s laptop accessing the same WiFi
        network, also create interference for your transmissions.

        <p>In the ideal case, you would be the one and only user within a
        certain frequency range, with no other background noise or
        interference. Unfortunately, that’s unlikely. First, bandwidth is
        scarce, and second, there are simply too many wireless devices to make
        that work. Instead, to achieve the desired data rate where interference
        is present, we can either increase the transmit power, thereby
        increasing the strength of the signal, or decrease the distance between
        the transmitter and the receiver—or both, of course.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-WWt5INcYTm">
          <p>Path loss, or path attenuation, is the reduction in signal power
          with respect to distance traveled—the exact reduction rate depends on
          the environment. A full discussion on this is outside the scope of
          this book, but if you are curious, consult your favorite search
          engine.
        </div>

        <p>To illustrate the relationship between signal, noise, transmit
        power, and distance, imagine you are in a small room and talking to
        someone 20 feet away. If nobody else is present, you can hold a
        conversation at normal volume. However, now add a few dozen people into
        the same room, such as at a crowded party, each carrying their own
        conversations. All of the sudden, it would be impossible for you to
        hear your peer! Of course, you could start speaking louder, but doing
        so would raise the amount of "noise" for everyone around you. In turn,
        they would start speaking louder also and further escalate the amount
        of noise and interference. Before you know it, everyone in the room is
        only able to communicate from a few feet away from each other
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#cell-breathing">Figure&nbsp;5-2</a>). If
        you have ever lost your voice at a rowdy party, or had to lean in to
        hear a conversation, then you have firsthand experience with SNR.

        <figure id="cell-breathing">

        <dl>
          <dt>Near-far problem

          <dd>
            <p>A condition in which a receiver captures a strong signal and
            thereby makes it impossible for the receiver to detect a weaker
            signal, effectively "crowding out" the weaker signal.

          <dt>Cell-breathing

          <dd>
            <p>A condition in which the coverage area, or the distance of the
            signal, expands and shrinks based on the cumulative noise and
            interference levels.
          </dl>

        <p>One, or more loud speakers beside you can block out weaker signals
        from farther away—the near-far problem. Similarly, the larger the
        number of other conversations around you, the higher the interference
        and the smaller the range from which you can discern a useful
        signal—cell-breathing. Not surprisingly, these same limitations are
        present in all forms of radio communication as well, regardless of
        protocol or underlying technology.

        "anchor">§</a>Modulation</h3>

        <p>Available bandwidth and SNR are the two primary, physical factors
        that dictate the capacity of every wireless channel. However, the
        algorithm by which the signal is encoded can also have a significant
        effect.

        <p>In a nutshell, our digital alphabet (1's and 0's), needs to be
        translated into an analog signal (a radio wave). <em>Modulation</em> is
        the process of digital-to-analog conversion, and different "modulation
        alphabets" can be used to encode the digital signal with different
        efficiency. The combination of the alphabet and the symbol rate is what
        then determines the final throughput of the channel. As a hands-on
        example:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Receiver and sender can process 1,000 pulses or symbols per
            second (1,000 baud).

          <li>
            <p>Each transmitted symbol represents a different bit-sequence,
            determined by the chosen alphabet (e.g., 2-bit alphabet: 00, 01,
            10, 11).

          <li>
            <p>The bit rate of the channel is 1,000 baud × 2 bits per symbol,
            or 2,000 bits per second.
          </ul>

        <p>The choice of the modulation algorithm depends on the available
        technology, computing power of both the receiver and sender, as well as
        the SNR ratio. A higher-order modulation alphabet comes at a cost of
        reduced robustness to noise and interference—there is no free lunch!

        <div data-type="note" id="id-RPtgsdhqT2">
          <p>Don’t worry, we are not planning to dive headfirst into the world
          of signal processing. Rather, it is simply important to understand
          that the choice of the modulation algorithm does affect the capacity
          of the wireless channel, but it is also subject to SNR, available
          processing power, and all other common trade-offs.

      "#measuring-real-world-wireless-performance" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Measuring Real-World Wireless Performance</h2>

      <p>Our brief crash course on signal theory can be summed up as follows:
      the performance of any wireless network, regardless of the name, acronym,
      or the revision number, is fundamentally limited by a small number of
      well-known parameters. Specifically, the amount of allocated bandwidth
      and the signal-to-noise ratio between receiver and sender. Further, all
      radio-powered communication is:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Done over a shared communication medium (radio waves)

        <li>
          <p>Regulated to use specific bandwidth frequency ranges

        <li>
          <p>Regulated to use specific transmit power rates

        <li>
          <p>Subject to continuously changing background noise and interference

        <li>
          <p>Subject to technical constraints of the chosen wireless technology

        <li>
          <p>Subject to constraints of the device: form factor, power, etc.
        </ul>

      <p>All wireless technologies advertise a peak, or a maximum data rate.
      For example, the 802.11g standard is capable of 54 Mbit/s, and the
      802.11n standard raises the bar up to 600 Mbit/s. Similarly, some mobile
      carriers are advertising 100+ MBit/s throughput with LTE. However, the
      most important part that is often overlooked when analyzing all these
      numbers is the emphasis on <em>in ideal conditions</em>.

      <p>What are ideal conditions? You guessed it: maximum amount of allotted
      bandwidth, exclusive use of the frequency spectrum, minimum or no
      background noise, highest-throughput modulation alphabet, and,
      increasingly, multiple radio streams (multiple-input and multiple-output,
      or MIMO) transmitting in parallel. Needless to say, what you see on the
      label and what you experience in the real world might be (read, will be)
      very different.

      <p>Just a few factors that may affect the performance of your wireless
      network:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Amount of distance between receiver and sender

        <li>
          <p>Amount of background noise in current location

        <li>
          <p>Amount of interference from users in the same network (intra-cell)

        <li>
          <p>Amount of interference from users in other, nearby networks
          (inter-cell)

        <li>
          <p>Amount of available transmit power, both at receiver and sender

        <li>
          <p>Amount of processing power and the chosen modulation scheme
        </ul>

      <p>In other words, if you want maximum throughput, then try to remove any
      noise and interference you can control, place your receiver and sender as
      close as possible, give them all the power they desire, and make sure
      both select the best modulation method. Or, if you are bent on
      performance, just run a physical wire between the two! The convenience of
      wireless communication does have its costs.

      <p>Measuring wireless performance is a tricky business. A small change,
      on the order of a few inches, in the location of the receiver can easily
      double throughput, and a few instants later the throughput could be
      halved again because another receiver has just woken up and is now
      competing for access to the radio channel. By its very nature, wireless
      performance is highly variable.

      <p>Finally, note that all of the previous discussions have been focused
      exclusively on throughput. Are we omitting latency on purpose? In fact,
      we have so far, because latency performance in wireless networks is
      directly tied to the specific technology in use, and that is the subject
      we turn to next.
