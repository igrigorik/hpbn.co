      <p>The emergence and the fast growth of the web performance optimization
      (WPO) industry within the past few years is a telltale sign of the
      growing importance and demand for speed and faster user experiences by
      the users. And this is not simply a psychological <em>need for speed</em>
      in our ever accelerating and connected world, but a requirement driven by
      empirical results, as measured with respect to the bottom-line
      performance of the many online businesses:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Faster sites lead to better user engagement.

        <li>
          <p>Faster sites lead to better user retention.

        <li>
          <p>Faster sites lead to higher conversions.
      </ul>

      <p>Simply put, speed is a feature. And to deliver it, we need to
      understand the many factors and fundamental limitations that are at play.
      In this chapter, we will focus on the two critical components that
      dictate the performance of all network traffic: latency and bandwidth
      (<a data-type="xref" href="#bw-latency-fig">Figure&nbsp;1-1</a>).

      <dl>
        <dt>Latency

        <dd>
          <p>The time from the source sending a packet to the destination
          receiving it

        <dt>Bandwidth

        <dd>
          <p>Maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path
      </dl>

          <span class="label">Figure 1-1.</span> Latency and bandwidth

      </figure>

      <p>Armed with a better understanding of how bandwidth and latency work
      together, we will then have the tools to dive deeper into the internals
      and performance characteristics of TCP, UDP, and all application
      protocols above them.

        <a href="#decreasing-transatlantic-latency-with-hibernia-express"
        class="anchor">§</a>Decreasing Transatlantic Latency with Hibernia
        Express</h4>

        <p>Latency is an important criteria for many high-frequency trading
        algorithms in the financial markets, where a small edge of a few
        milliseconds can translate to millions in loss or profit.

        <p>In September 2015, Hibernia Networks launched a new fiber-optic link
        ("Hibernia Express") specifically designed to ensure the lowest latency
        between New York and London by following the great circle route between
        the cities. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $300M+ and
        the new route boasts 58.95 ms latency between the cities, which gives
        it a ~5 millisecond edge compared to all other existing transatlantic
        links. This translates to $60M+ per millisecond saved!

        <p>Latency is expensive — literally and figuratively.

    <section>
      <h2 id="the-many-components-of-latency"><a href=
      "#the-many-components-of-latency" class="anchor">§</a>The Many Components
      of Latency</h2>

      <p>Latency is the time it takes for a message, or a packet, to travel
      from its point of origin to the point of destination. That is a simple
      and useful definition, but it often hides a lot of useful information —
      every system contains multiple sources, or components, contributing to
      the overall time it takes for a message to be delivered, and it is
      important to understand what these components are and what dictates their
      performance.

      <p>Let’s take a closer look at some common contributing components for a
      typical router on the Internet, which is responsible for relaying a
      message between the client and the server:

      <dl>
        <dt>Propagation delay

        <dd>
          <p>Amount of time required for a message to travel from the sender to
          receiver, which is a function of distance over speed with which the
          signal propagates.

        <dt>Transmission delay

        <dd>
          <p>Amount of time required to push all the packet’s bits into the
          link, which is a function of the packet’s length and data rate of the
          link.

        <dt>Processing delay

        <dd>
          <p>Amount of time required to process the packet header, check for
          bit-level errors, and determine the packet’s destination.

        <dt>Queuing delay

        <dd>
          <p>Amount of time the packet is waiting in the queue until it can be
          processed.
      </dl>

      <p>The total latency between the client and the server is the sum of all
      the delays just listed. Propagation time is dictated by the distance and
      the medium through which the signal travels — as we will see, the
      propagation speed is usually within a small constant factor of the speed
      of light. On the other hand, transmission delay is dictated by the
      available data rate of the transmitting link and has nothing to do with
      the distance between the client and the server. As an example, let’s
      assume we want to transmit a 10 Mb file over two links: 1 Mbps and 100
      Mbps. It will take 10 seconds to put the entire file "on the wire" over
      the 1 Mbps link and only 0.1 seconds over the 100 Mbps link.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-Wms6U1SP">
        <p>Network data rates are typically measured in bits per second (bps),
        whereas data rates for non-network equipment are typically shown in
        bytes per second (Bps). This is a common source of confusion, pay close
        attention to the units.

        <p>For example, to put a 10 megabyte (MB) file "on the wire" over a
        1Mbps link, we will need 80 seconds. 10MB is equal to 80Mb because
        there are 8 bits for every byte!
      </div>

      <p>Next, once the packet arrives at the router, the router must examine
      the packet header to determine the outgoing route and may run other
      checks on the data — this takes time as well. Much of this logic is now
      often done in hardware, so the delays are very small, but they do exist.
      And, finally, if the packets are arriving at a faster rate than the
      router is capable of processing, then the packets are queued inside an
      incoming buffer. The time data spends queued inside the buffer is, not
      surprisingly, known as queuing delay.

      <p>Each packet traveling over the network will incur many instances of
      each of these delays. The farther the distance between the source and
      destination, the more time it will take to propagate. The more
      intermediate routers we encounter along the way, the higher the
      processing and transmission delays for each packet. Finally, the higher
      the load of traffic along the path, the higher the likelihood of our
      packet being queued and delayed inside one or more buffers.

        <h4 id="bufferbloat-in-your-local-router"><a href=
        "#bufferbloat-in-your-local-router" class="anchor">§</a>Bufferbloat in
        Your Local Router</h4>

        <p><em>Bufferbloat</em> is a term that was coined and popularized by
        Jim Gettys in 2010, and is a great example of queuing delay affecting
        the overall performance of the network.

        <p>The underlying problem is that many routers are now shipping with
        large incoming buffers under the assumption that dropping packets
        should be avoided at all costs. However, this breaks TCP’s congestion
        avoidance mechanisms (which we will cover in the next chapter), and
        introduces high and variable latency delays into the network.

        <p>The good news is that the new CoDel active queue management
        algorithm has been proposed to address this problem, and is now
        implemented within the Linux 3.5+ kernels. To learn more, refer to
        <a href="https://hpbn.co/aqmacm">"Controlling Queue Delay"</a> in ACM
        Queue.

      <h2 id="speed-of-light-and-propagation-latency"><a href=
      "#speed-of-light-and-propagation-latency" class="anchor">§</a>Speed of
      Light and Propagation Latency</h2>

      <p>As Einstein outlined in his theory of special relativity, the speed of
      light is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information
      can travel. This observation places a hard limit, and a governor, on the
      propagation time of any network packet.

      <p>The good news is the speed of light is high: 299,792,458 meters per
      second, or 186,282 miles per second. However, and there is always a
      however, that is the speed of light in a vacuum. Instead, our packets
      travel through a medium such as a copper wire or a fiber-optic cable,
      which will slow down the signal (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#geo-latency-table">Table&nbsp;1-1</a>). This ratio of the speed of
      light and the speed with which the packet travels in a material is known
      as the refractive index of the material. The larger the value, the slower
      light travels in that medium.

      <p>The typical refractive index value of an optical fiber, through which
      most of our packets travel for long-distance hops, can vary between 1.4
      to 1.6 — slowly but surely we are making improvements in the quality of
      the materials and are able to lower the refractive index. But to keep it
      simple, the rule of thumb is to assume that the speed of light in fiber
      is around 200,000,000 meters per second, which corresponds to a
      refractive index of ~1.5. The remarkable part about this is that we are
      already within a small constant factor of the maximum speed! An amazing
      engineering achievement in its own right.

      <p>The speed of light is fast, but it nonetheless takes 160 milliseconds
      to make the round-trip (RTT) from New York to Sydney. In fact, the
      numbers in <a data-type="xref" href=
      "#geo-latency-table">Table&nbsp;1-1</a> are also unrealistically
      optimistic in that they assume that the packet travels over a fiber-optic
      cable along the great-circle path (the shortest distance between two
      points on the globe) between the cities. In practice, that is rarely the
      case, and the packet would take a much longer route between New York and
      Sydney. Each hop along this route will introduce additional routing,
      processing, queuing, and transmission delays. As a result, the actual RTT
      between New York and Sydney, over our existing networks, works out to be
      in the 200–300 millisecond range. All things considered, that still seems
      pretty fast, right?

      <p>We are not accustomed to measuring our everyday encounters in
      milliseconds, but studies have shown that most of us will reliably report
      perceptible "lag" once a delay of over 100–200 milliseconds is introduced
      into the system. Once the 300 millisecond delay threshold is exceeded,
      the interaction is often reported as "sluggish," and at the 1,000
      milliseconds (1 second) barrier, many users have already performed a
      mental context switch while waiting for the response — see <a data-type=
      "xref" href=
      "/primer-on-web-performance/#speed-performance-and-human-perception">Speed,
      Performance, and Human Perception</a>.

      <p>The point is simple, to deliver the best experience and to keep our
      users engaged in the task at hand, we need our applications to respond
      within hundreds of milliseconds. That doesn’t leave us, and especially
      the network, with much room for error. <strong>To succeed, network
      latency has to be carefully managed and be an explicit design criteria at
      all stages of development.</strong>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-xesGuDH5">
        <p>Content delivery network (CDN) services provide many benefits, but
        chief among them is the simple observation that distributing the
        content around the globe, and serving that content from a nearby
        location to the client, enables us to significantly reduce the
        propagation time of all the data packets.

        <p>We may not be able to make the packets travel faster, but we can
        reduce the distance by strategically positioning our servers closer to
        the users! Leveraging a CDN to serve your data can offer significant

      <h2 id="last-mile-latency"><a href="#last-mile-latency" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Last-Mile Latency</h2>

      <p>Ironically, it is often the last few miles, not the crossing of oceans
      or continents, where significant latency is introduced: the infamous
      last-mile problem. To connect your home or office to the Internet, your
      local ISP needs to route the cables throughout the neighborhood,
      aggregate the signal, and forward it to a local routing node. In
      practice, depending on the type of connectivity, routing methodology, and
      deployed technology, these first few hops alone can take tens of
      milliseconds.

      <p>According to the annual "Measuring Broadband America" reports
      conducted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the last-mile
      latencies for terrestrial-based broadband (DSL, cable, fiber) within the
      United States have remained relatively stable over time: fiber has best
      average performance (10-20 ms), followed by cable (15-40 ms), and DSL
      (30-65 ms).

      <p>In practice this translates into 10-65 ms of latency just to the
      closest measuring node within the ISP’s core network, before the packet
      is even routed to its destination! The FCC report is focused on the
      United States, but last-mile latency is a challenge for all Internet
      providers, regardless of geography. For the curious, a simple
      <code>traceroute</code> can often tell you volumes about the topology and
      performance of your Internet provider.

      </div>

      <p>In the previous example, the packet started in the city of Sunnyvale,
      bounced to Santa Clara, then Oakland, returned to San Jose, got routed to
      the "529 Bryant" datacenter, at which point it was routed toward Google
      and arrived at its destination on the 11th hop. This entire process took,
      on average, 18 milliseconds. Not bad, all things considered, but in the
      same time the packet could have traveled across most of the continental
      USA!

      <p>The last-mile latencies can vary wildly between ISP’s due to the
      deployed technology, topology of the network, and even the time of day.
      As an end user, and if you are looking to improve your web browsing
      speeds, make sure to measure and compare the last-mile latencies of the
      various providers available in your area.

        Latency with Traceroute</h4>

        <p>Traceroute is a simple network diagnostics tool for identifying the
        routing path of the packet and the latency of each network hop in an IP
        network. To identify the individual hops, it sends a sequence of
        packets toward the destination with an increasing "hop limit" (1, 2, 3,
        and so on). When the hop limit is reached, the intermediary returns an
        ICMP Time Exceeded message, allowing the tool to measure the latency
        for each network hop.

        <p>On Unix platforms the tool can be run from the command line via
        <code>traceroute</code>, and on Windows it is known as
        <code>tracert</code>.

      class="anchor">§</a>Bandwidth in Core Networks</h2>

      <p>An optical fiber acts as a simple "light pipe," slightly thicker than
      a human hair, designed to transmit light between the two ends of the
      cable. Metal wires are also used but are subject to higher signal loss,
      electromagnetic interference, and higher lifetime maintenance costs.
      Chances are, your packets will travel over both types of cable, but for
      any long-distance hops, they will be transmitted over a fiber-optic link.

      <p>Optical fibers have a distinct advantage when it comes to bandwidth
      because each fiber can carry many different wavelengths (channels) of
      light through a process known as wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM).
      Hence, the total bandwidth of a fiber link is the multiple of per-channel
      data rate and the number of multiplexed channels.

      <p>As of early 2010, researchers have been able to multiplex over 400
      wavelengths with the peak capacity of 171 Gbit/s per channel, which
      translates to over 70 Tbit/s of total bandwidth for a single fiber link!
      We would need thousands of copper wire (electrical) links to match this
      throughput. Not surprisingly, most long-distance hops, such as subsea
      data transmission between continents, is now done over fiber-optic links.
      Each cable carries several strands of fiber (four strands is a common
      number), which translates into bandwidth capacity in hundreds of terabits
      per second for each cable.

      <p>The backbones, or the fiber links, that form the core data paths of
      the Internet are capable of moving hundreds of terabits per second.
      However, the available capacity at the edges of the network is much, much
      less, and varies wildly based on deployed technology: dial-up, DSL,
      cable, a host of wireless technologies, fiber-to-the-home, and even the
      performance of the local router. The available bandwidth to the user is a
      function of the lowest capacity link between the client and the
      destination server (<a data-type="xref" href=

      </figure>

      <p>The preceding data excludes traffic from mobile carriers, a topic we
      will come back to later to examine in closer detail. For now, it should
      suffice to say that mobile speeds are highly variable and generally
      slower. However, even with that in mind, the average global broadband
      bandwidth in late 2015 was just 5.1 Mbps! South Korea led the world with
      a 20.5 Mbps average throughput, and United States came in 21st place with
      12.6 Mbps.

      <p>As a reference point, streaming an HD video can require anywhere from
      2 to 10 Mbps depending on resolution and the codec. So an average user
      within the United States can stream a high-resolution video at the
      network edge, but doing so would also consume much of their link capacity
      — not a very promising story for a household with multiple users.

      <p>Figuring out where the bandwidth bottleneck is for any given user is
      often a nontrivial but important exercise. Once again, for the curious,
      there are a number of online services, such as <a href=
      "http://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a> operated by Ookla (<a data-type=
      "xref" href="#fig2">Figure&nbsp;1-2</a>), which provide upstream and
      downstream tests against a nearby server — we will see why picking a
      local server is important in our discussion on TCP. Running a test on one
      of these services is a good way to check that your connection meets the
      advertised speeds of your local ISP.

      <figure id="fig2">

      </figure>

      <p>However, while a high-bandwidth link to your ISP is desirable, it is
      also not a guarantee of end-to-end performance; just because a bandwidth
      test promises high data rates does not mean that you can or should expect
      same performance from other remote servers. The network could be
      congested at any intermediate node due to high demand, hardware failures,
      a concentrated network attack, or a host of other reasons. High
      variability of throughput and latency performance is an inherent property
      of our data networks — predicting, managing, and adapting to the
      continuously changing "network weather" is a complex task.

      <h2 id="delivering-higher-bandwidth-and-lower-latencies"><a href=
      "#delivering-higher-bandwidth-and-lower-latencies" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Delivering Higher Bandwidth and Lower Latencies</h2>

      <p>Our demand for higher bandwidth is growing fast, in large part due to
      the rising popularity of streaming video, which is now responsible for
      well over half of all Internet traffic. The good news is, while it may
      not be cheap, there are multiple strategies available for us to grow the
      available capacity: we can add more fibers into our fiber-optic links, we
      can deploy more links across the congested routes, or we can improve the
      WDM techniques to transfer more data through existing links.

      <p>TeleGeography, a telecommunications market research and consulting
      firm, estimates that as of 2011, we are using, on average, just 20% of
      the available capacity of the deployed subsea fiber links. Even more
      importantly, between 2007 and 2011, more than half of all the added
      capacity of the trans-Pacific cables was due to WDM upgrades: same fiber
      links, better technology on both ends to multiplex the data. Of course,
      we cannot expect these advances to go on indefinitely, as every medium
      reaches a point of diminishing returns. Nonetheless, as long as economics
      of the enterprise permit, there is no fundamental reason why bandwidth
      throughput cannot be increased over time — if all else fails, we can add
      more fiber links.

      <p>Improving latency, on the other hand, is a very different story. The
      quality of the fiber links could be improved to get us a little closer to
      the speed of light: better materials with lower refractive index and
      faster routers along the way. However, given that our current speeds are
      within ~2/3 of the speed of light, the most we can expect from this
      strategy is just a modest 30% improvement. Unfortunately, there is simply
      no way around the laws of physics: the speed of light places a hard limit
      on the minimum latency.

      <p>Alternatively, since we can’t make light travel faster, we can make
      the distance shorter — the shortest distance between any two points on
      the globe is defined by the great-circle path between them. However,
      laying new cables is also not always possible due to the constraints
      imposed by the physical terrain, social and political reasons, and of
      course, the associated costs.

      <p>As a result, to improve performance of our applications, we need to
      architect and optimize our protocols and networking code with explicit
      awareness of the limitations of available bandwidth and the speed of
      light: we need to reduce round trips, move the data closer to the client,
      and build applications that can hide the latency through caching,
      pre-fetching, and a variety of similar techniques, as explained in
      subsequent chapters.
