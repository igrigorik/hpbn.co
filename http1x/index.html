      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>A discussion on optimization strategies for HTTP/1.0 is a simple one:
      all HTTP/1.0 deployments should be upgraded to HTTP/1.1; end of story.

      <p>Improving performance of HTTP was one the key design goals for the
      HTTP/1.1 working group, and the standard introduced a large number of
      critical performance enhancements and features. A few of the best known
      include the following:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Persistent connections to allow connection reuse

        <li>
          <p>Chunked transfer encoding to allow response streaming

        <li>
          <p>Request pipelining to allow parallel request processing

        <li>
          <p>Byte serving to allow range-based resource requests

        <li>
          <p>Improved and much better-specified caching mechanisms
        </ul>

      <p>This list is incomplete, and a full discussion of the technical
      details of each and every HTTP/1.1 enhancement deserves a separate book.
      Once again, check out <em>HTTP: The Definitive Guide</em> by David
      Gourley and Brian Totty. Similarly, speaking of good reference books,
      Steve Souders’ <em>High Performance Web Sites</em> offers great advice in
      the form of 14 rules, half of which are networking optimizations:

      <dl>
        <dt>Reduce DNS lookups

        <dd>
          <p>Every hostname resolution requires a network roundtrip, imposing
          latency on the request and blocking the request while the lookup is
          in progress.

        <dt>Make fewer HTTP requests

        <dd>
          <p>No request is faster than a request not made: eliminate
          unnecessary resources on your pages.

        <dt>Use a Content Delivery Network

        <dd>
          <p>Locating the data geographically closer to the client can
          significantly reduce the network latency of every TCP connection and
          improve throughput.

        <dt>Add an Expires header and configure ETags

        <dd>
          <p>Relevant resources should be cached to avoid re-requesting the
          same bytes on each and every page. An Expires header can be used to
          specify the cache lifetime of the object, allowing it to be retrieved
          directly from the user’s cache and eliminating the HTTP request
          entirely. ETags and Last-Modified headers provide an efficient cache
          revalidation mechanism—effectively a fingerprint or a timestamp of
          the last update.

        <dt>Gzip assets

        <dd>
          <p>All text-based assets should be compressed with Gzip when
          transferred between the client and the server. On average, Gzip will
          reduce the file size by 60–80%, which makes it one of the simpler
          (configuration flag on the server) and high-benefit optimizations you
          can do.

        <dt>Avoid HTTP redirects

        <dd>
          <p>HTTP redirects can be extremely costly, especially when they
          redirect the client to a different hostname, which results in
          additional DNS lookup, TCP connection latency, and so on.
        </dl>

      <p>Each of the preceding recommendations has stood the test of time and
      is as true today as when the book was first published in 2007. That is no
      coincidence, because all of them highlight two fundamental
      recommendations: eliminate and reduce unnecessary network latency, and
      minimize the amount of transferred bytes. Both are <em>evergreen
      optimizations</em>, which will always ring true for any application.

      <p>However, the same can’t be said for all HTTP/1.1 features and best
      practices. Unfortunately, some HTTP/1.1 features, like request
      pipelining, have effectively failed due to lack of support, and other
      protocol limitations, such as head-of-line response blocking, created
      further cracks in the foundation. In turn, the web developer
      community—always an inventive lot—has created and popularized a number of
      homebrew optimizations: domain sharding, concatenation, spriting, and
      inlining among dozens of others.

      <p>For many web developers, all of these are matter-of-fact
      optimizations: familiar, necessary, and universally accepted. However, in
      reality, these techniques should be seen for what they really are:
      stopgap workarounds for existing limitations in the HTTP/1.1 protocol. We
      shouldn’t have to worry about concatenating files, spriting images,
      sharding domains, or inlining assets. Unfortunately, "shouldn’t" is not a
      pragmatic stance to take: these optimizations exist for good reasons, and
      we have to rely on them until the underlying issues are fixed in the next
      revision of the protocol.

        <p>At WWDC 2012, Joshua Graessley offered a great case study of the
        benefits of HTTP optimization: Apple engineers saw a 300% performance
        improvement for users on slower networks once they made better reuse of
        existing TCP connections within iTunes, via HTTP keepalive and
        pipelining!

        <p>Clearly, understanding the basic working of HTTP can pay high
        dividends. For a detailed analysis of the previous optimizations, check
        out WWDC archives on iTunes and look for Graessley’s talk: Session 706:

      <h2 id="benefits-of-keepalive-connections"><a href=
      "#benefits-of-keepalive-connections" class="anchor">§</a>Benefits of
      Keepalive Connections</h2>

      <p>One of the primary performance improvements of HTTP/1.1 was the
      introduction of persistent, or keepalive HTTP connections—both names
      refer to the same feature. We saw keepalive in action in <a data-type=
      "xref" href="/brief-history-of-http/#http11-internet-standard">HTTP/1.1:
      Internet Standard</a>, but let’s illustrate why this feature is such a
      critical component of our performance strategy.

      <p>To keep things simple, let’s restrict ourselves to a maximum of one
      TCP connection and examine the scenario (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-no-keepalive">Figure&nbsp;11-1</a>) where we need to fetch just
      two small (&lt;4 KB each) resources: an HTML document and a supporting
      CSS file, each taking some arbitrary amount of time on the server (40 and
      20 ms, respectively).

      <div data-type="note" id="id-qMu7tYH9">
        <p><a data-type="xref" href="#http-no-keepalive">Figure&nbsp;11-1</a>
        assumes the same 28 millisecond one-way "light in fiber" delay between
        New York and London as used in previous TCP connection establishment
        examples; see <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#geo-latency-table">Table&nbsp;1-1</a>.
      </div>

      <p>Each TCP connection begins with a TCP three-way handshake, which takes
      a full roundtrip of latency between the client and the server. Following
      that, we will incur a minimum of another roundtrip of latency due to the
      two-way propagation delay of the HTTP request and response. Finally, we
      have to add the server processing time to get the total time for every
      request.

      <figure id="http-no-keepalive">
        <img src="/assets/diagrams/84cf0f29175e4b11a2343e73105637c5.svg" alt=
        "Figure 11-1. Fetching HTML and CSS via separate TCP connections">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 11-1.</span> Fetching HTML and CSS via
          separate TCP connections
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>We cannot predict the server processing time, since that will vary by
      resource and the back-end behind it, but it is worth highlighting that
      the minimum total time for an HTTP request delivered via a new TCP
      connection is two network roundtrips: one for the handshake, one for the
      request-response cycle. This is a fixed cost imposed on all
      non-persistent HTTP sessions.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-76uVFOH1">
        <p>The faster your server processing time, the higher the impact of the
        fixed latency overhead of every network request! To prove this, try
        changing the roundtrip and server times in the previous example.
      </div>

      <p>Hence, a simple optimization is to reuse the underlying connection!
      Adding support for HTTP keepalive (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-keepalive">Figure&nbsp;11-2</a>) allows us to eliminate the second
      TCP three-way handshake, avoid another round of TCP slow-start, and save
      a full roundtrip of network latency.

      <figure id="http-keepalive">
        <img src="/assets/diagrams/cf6057a54f005a288d832d293965ee0d.svg" alt=

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 11-2.</span> Fetching HTML and CSS with
          connection keepalive
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In our example with two requests, the total savings is just a single
      roundtrip of latency, but let’s now consider the general case with a
      single TCP connection and <em>N</em> HTTP requests:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Without keepalive, each request will incur two roundtrips of
          latency.

        <li>
          <p>With keepalive, the first request incurs two roundtrips, and all
          following requests incur just one roundtrip of latency.
        </ul>

      <p>The total latency savings for <em>N</em> requests is <em>(N–1)</em> ×
      <em>RTT</em> when connection keepalive is enabled. Finally, recall that
      the average value of <em>N</em> is 90 resources and growing
      (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "/primer-on-web-performance/#anatomy-of-a-modern-web-application">Anatomy
      of a Modern Web Application</a>), and we quickly arrive at potential
      latency savings measured in seconds! Needless to say, persistent HTTP is
      a critical optimization for every web application.

      <aside>
        <h4 id="connection-reuse-on-the-client-and-server"><a href=
        "#connection-reuse-on-the-client-and-server" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Connection Reuse on the Client and Server</h4>

        <p>The good news is all modern browsers will attempt to use persistent
        HTTP connections automatically as long as the server is willing to
        cooperate. Check your application and proxy server configurations to
        ensure that they support keepalive. For best results, use HTTP/1.1,
        where keepalive is enabled by default, and if you are stuck with
        HTTP/1.0, then look into using the <code>Connection: Keep-Alive</code>
        header.

        <p>Also, pay close attention to the default behavior of HTTP libraries
        and frameworks, as many will often default to non-keepalive behavior,
        mostly because it provides a "simpler API." Whenever you are working
        with raw HTTP connections, attempt to reuse them: the performance
        benefits are significant!
      </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="http-pipelining"><a href="#http-pipelining" class=
      "anchor">§</a>HTTP Pipelining</h2>

      <p>Persistent HTTP allows us to reuse an existing connection between
      multiple application requests, but it implies a strict first in, first
      out (FIFO) queuing order on the client: dispatch request, wait for the
      full response, dispatch next request from the client queue. HTTP
      pipelining is a small but important optimization to this workflow, which
      allows us to relocate the FIFO queue from the client (request queuing) to
      the server (response queuing).

      <p>To understand why this is beneficial, let’s revisit <a data-type=
      "xref" href="#http-keepalive">Figure&nbsp;11-2</a>. First, observe that
      once the first request is processed by the server, there is an entire
      roundtrip of latency—response propagation latency, followed by request
      propagation latency—during which the server is idle. Instead, what if the
      server could begin processing the second request immediately after it
      finished the first one? Or, even better, perhaps it could even process
      both in parallel, on multiple threads, or with the help of multiple
      workers.

      <p>By dispatching our requests early, without blocking on each individual
      response, we can eliminate another full roundtrip of network latency,
      taking us from two roundtrips per request with no connection keepalive,
      down to two network roundtrips (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-pipelining-diagram">Figure&nbsp;11-3</a>) of latency overhead for
      the entire queue of requests!

      <figure id="http-pipelining-diagram">
        <img src="/assets/diagrams/aa67e02b5a082ef886f2db4c9a9c38cc.svg" alt=
        "Figure 11-3. Pipelined HTTP requests with server-side FIFO queue">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 11-3.</span> Pipelined HTTP requests with
          server-side FIFO queue
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-AouzTWhd">
        <p>Eliminating the wait time imposed by response and request
        propagation latencies is one of the primary benefits of HTTP/1.1
        pipelining. However, the ability to process the requests in parallel
        can have just as big, if not bigger, impact on the performance of your
        application.
      </div>

      <p>At this point, let’s pause and revisit our performance gains so far.
      We began with two distinct TCP connections for each request
      (<a data-type="xref" href="#http-no-keepalive">Figure&nbsp;11-1</a>),
      which resulted in 284 milliseconds of total latency. With keepalive
      enabled (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-keepalive">Figure&nbsp;11-2</a>), we were able to eliminate an
      extra handshake roundtrip, bringing the total down to 228 milliseconds.
      Finally, with HTTP pipelining in place, we eliminated another network
      roundtrip in between requests. Hence, we went from 284 milliseconds down
      to 172 milliseconds, a 40% reduction in total latency, all through simple
      protocol optimization.

      <p>Further, note that the 40% improvement is not a fixed performance
      gain. This number is specific to our chosen network latencies and the two
      requests in our example. As an exercise for the reader, try a few
      additional scenarios with higher latencies and more requests. You may be
      surprised to discover that the savings can be much, much larger. In fact,
      the larger the network latency, and the more requests, the higher the
      savings. It is worth proving to yourself that this is indeed the case!
      Ergo, the larger the application, the larger the impact of networking
      optimization.

      <p>However, we are not done yet. The eagle-eyed among you have likely
      spotted another opportunity for optimization: parallel request processing
      on the server. In theory, there is no reason why the server could not
      have processed both pipelined requests (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-pipelining-diagram">Figure&nbsp;11-3</a>) in parallel, eliminating
      another 20 milliseconds of latency.

      <p>Unfortunately, this optimization introduces a lot of subtle
      implications and illustrates an important limitation of the HTTP/1.x
      protocol: strict serialization of returned responses. Specifically,
      HTTP/1.x does not allow data from multiple responses to be interleaved
      (multiplexed) on the same connection, forcing each response to be
      returned in full before the bytes for the next response can be
      transferred. To illustrate this in action, let’s consider the case
      (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-pipelining-parallel">Figure&nbsp;11-4</a>) where the server
      processes both of our requests in parallel.

      <figure id="http-pipelining-parallel">
        <img src="/assets/diagrams/9e0502a36ccd2bdd00eb09e1e6cb3b6d.svg" alt=
        "Figure 11-4. Pipelined HTTP requests with parallel processing">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 11-4.</span> Pipelined HTTP requests with
          parallel processing
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p><a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-pipelining-parallel">Figure&nbsp;11-4</a> demonstrates the
      following:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Both HTML and CSS requests arrive in parallel, but HTML request is
          first.

        <li>
          <p>Server begins processing both in parallel. HTML: 40 ms, CSS: 20
          ms.

        <li>
          <p>CSS request completes first but must be buffered until HTML
          response is sent.

        <li>
          <p>Once HTML response is sent, CSS response is flushed from the
          server buffers.
        </ul>

      <p>Even though the client issued both requests in parallel, and the CSS
      resource is available first, the server must wait to send the full HTML
      response before it can proceed with delivery of the CSS asset. This
      scenario is commonly known as <em>head-of-line blocking</em> and results
      in suboptimal delivery: underutilized network links, server buffering
      costs, and worst of all, unpredictable latency delays for the client.
      What if the first request hangs indefinitely or simply takes a very long
      time to generate on the server? With HTTP/1.1, all requests behind it are
      blocked and have to wait.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-d0uOs7hR">
        <p>We have already encountered head-of-line blocking when discussing
        TCP: due to the requirement for strict in-order delivery, a lost TCP
        packet will block all packets with higher sequence numbers until it is
        retransmitted, inducing extra application latency; see TCP

      <p>In practice, due to lack of multiplexing, HTTP pipelining creates many
      subtle and undocumented implications for HTTP servers, intermediaries,
      and clients:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A single slow response blocks all requests behind it.

        <li>
          <p>When processing in parallel, servers must buffer pipelined
          responses, which may exhaust server resources—e.g., what if one of
          the responses is very large? This exposes an attack vector against
          the server!

        <li>
          <p>A failed response may terminate the TCP connection, forcing the
          client to re-request all the subsequent resources, which may cause
          duplicate processing.

        <li>
          <p>Detecting pipelining compatibility reliably, where intermediaries
          may be present, is a nontrivial problem.

        <li>
          <p>Some intermediaries do not support pipelining and may abort the
          connection, while others may serialize all requests.
        </ul>

      <p>Due to these and similar complications, and lack of guidance in the
      HTTP/1.1 standard for these cases, HTTP pipelining adoption has remained
      very limited despite its many benefits. Today, some browsers support
      pipelining, usually as an advanced configuration option, but most have it
      disabled. In other words, if the web browser is the primary delivery
      vehicle for your web application, then we can’t count on HTTP pipelining
      to help with performance.

      <aside>
        <h4 id="using-http-pipelining-outside-the-browser"><a href=
        "#using-http-pipelining-outside-the-browser" class="anchor">§</a>Using
        HTTP Pipelining Outside the Browser</h4>

        <p>Before we discount the benefits of HTTP pipelining entirely, it is
        important to note that it can still be used, and with great results, in
        situations where you control the capabilities of both the client and
        the server. In fact, Apple’s iTunes case study is a case in point:
        <a data-type="xref" href=
        "#delivering-3-performance-improvement-for-itunes-users">Delivering 3×
        Performance Improvement for iTunes Users</a>. This performance feat was
        accomplished by switching to persistent HTTP and enabling HTTP
        pipelining both on the server and within the custom iTunes client.

        <p>A quick checklist for enabling pipelining in your own application:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Your HTTP client must support pipelining.

          <li>
            <p>Your HTTP server must support pipelining.

          <li>
            <p>Your application must handle aborted connections and retries.

          <li>
            <p>Your application must handle idempotency concerns of aborted
            requests.

          <li>
            <p>Your application must protect itself from broken intermediaries.
          </ul>

        <p>In practice, the best way to deploy HTTP pipelining is to create a
        secure (HTTPS) tunnel between the client and server. That’s the most
        reliable way to avoid interference from intermediaries that may not
        understand or support pipelined requests.

      <h2 id="using-multiple-tcp-connections"><a href=
      "#using-multiple-tcp-connections" class="anchor">§</a>Using Multiple TCP
      Connections</h2>

      <p>In absence of multiplexing in HTTP/1.x, the browser could naively
      queue all HTTP requests on the client, sending one after another over a
      single, persistent connection. However, in practice, this is too slow.
      Hence, the browser vendors are left with no other choice than to open
      multiple TCP sessions in parallel. How many? In practice, most modern
      browsers, both desktop and mobile, open up to six connections per host.

      <p>Before we go any further, it is worth contemplating the implications,
      both positive and negative, of opening multiple TCP connections in
      parallel. Let’s consider the maximum case with six independent
      connections per host:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The client can dispatch up to six requests in parallel.

        <li>
          <p>The server can process up to six requests in parallel.

        <li>
          <p>The cumulative number of packets that can be sent in the first
          roundtrip (TCP cwnd) is increased by a factor of six.
        </ul>

      <p>The maximum request parallelism, in absence of pipelining, is the same
      as the number of open connections. Further, the TCP congestion window is
      also effectively multiplied by the number of open connections, allowing
      the client to circumvent the configured packet limit dictated by TCP
      slow-start. So far, this seems like a convenient workaround! However,
      let’s now consider some of the costs:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Additional sockets consuming resources on the client, server, and
          all intermediaries: extra memory buffers and CPU overhead

        <li>
          <p>Competition for shared bandwidth between parallel TCP streams

        <li>
          <p>Much higher implementation complexity for handling collections of
          sockets

        <li>
          <p>Limited application parallelism even in light of parallel TCP
          streams
        </ul>

      <p>In practice, the CPU and memory costs are nontrivial, resulting in
      much higher per-client overhead on both client and server—higher
      operational costs. Similarly, we raise the implementation complexity on
      the client—higher development costs. Finally, this approach still
      delivers only limited benefits as far as application parallelism is
      concerned. It’s not the right long-term solution. Having said that, there
      are three valid reasons why we have to use it today:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>As a workaround for limitations of the application protocol (HTTP)

        <li>
          <p>As a workaround for low starting congestion window size in TCP

        <li>
          <p>As a workaround for clients that cannot use TCP window scaling
          (see <a data-type="xref" href=
          "/building-blocks-of-tcp/#bandwidth-delay-product">Bandwidth-Delay
          Product</a>)
        </ol>

      <p>Both TCP considerations (window scaling and cwnd) are best addressed
      by a simple upgrade to the latest OS kernel release; see <a data-type=
      "xref" href="/building-blocks-of-tcp/#optimizing-for-tcp">Optimizing for
      TCP</a>. The cwnd value has been recently raised to 10 packets, and all
      the latest platforms provide robust support for TCP window scaling.
      That’s the good news. The bad news is there is no simple workaround for
      fixing multiplexing in HTTP/1.x.

      <p>As long as we need to support HTTP/1.x clients, we are stuck with
      having to juggle multiple TCP streams. Which brings us to the next
      obvious question: why and how did the browsers settle on six connections
      per host? Unfortunately, as you may have guessed, the number is based on
      a collection of trade-offs: the higher the limit, the higher the client
      and server overhead, but at the additional benefit of higher request
      parallelism. Six connections per host is simply a safe middle ground. For
      some sites, this may provide great results; for many it is insufficient.

      <aside>
        <h4 id="exhausting-client-and-server-resources"><a href=
        "#exhausting-client-and-server-resources" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Exhausting Client and Server Resources</h4>

        <p>Limiting the maximum number of connections per host allows the
        browser to provide a safety check against an unintentional (or
        intentional) denial of service (DoS) attack. In absence of such limit,
        the client could saturate all available resources on the server.

        <p>Ironically, this same safety check enables the reverse attack on
        some browsers: if the maximum connection limit is exceeded on the
        client, then all further client requests are blocked. As an experiment,
        open six parallel downloads to a single host, and then issue a seventh
        request: it will hang until one of the previous requests has completed.

        <p>Saturating the client connection limit may seem like a benign
        security flaw, but it is increasingly a real deployment problem for
        applications that rely on real-time delivery mechanisms, such as
        WebSocket, Server Sent Events and hanging XHRs: each of these sessions
        occupies a full TCP stream, even while no data is transferred—remember,
        no multiplexing! Hence, if you’re not careful, you can create a
        self-imposed DoS attack against your own application.

      <h2 id="domain-sharding"><a href="#domain-sharding" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Domain Sharding</h2>

      <p>A gap in the HTTP/1.X protocol has forced browser vendors to introduce
      and maintain a connection pool of up to six TCP streams per host. The
      good news is all of the connection management is handled by the browser
      itself. As an application developer, you don’t have to modify your
      application at all. The bad news is six parallel streams may still not be
      enough for your application.

      <p>According to HTTP Archive, an average page is now composed of 90+
      individual resources, which if delivered all by the same host would still
      result in significant queuing delays (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#waterfall-shards">Figure&nbsp;11-5</a>). Hence, why limit ourselves to
      the same host? Instead of serving all resources from the same origin
      (e.g., <em>www.example.com</em>), we can manually "shard" them across
      multiple subdomains: <em>{shard1, shardn}.example.com</em>. Because the
      hostnames are different, we are implicitly increasing the browser’s
      connection limit to achieve a higher level of parallelism. The more
      shards we use, the higher the parallelism!

      <figure id="waterfall-shards">
        <img src="/assets/diagrams/a2283460ffae3026632ff33c24bc5462.png" alt=

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Of course, there is no free lunch, and domain sharding is not an
      exception: every new hostname will require an additional DNS lookup,
      consume additional resources on both sides for each additional socket,
      and, worst of all, require the site author to manually manage where and
      how the resources are split.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-2OueT2iY">
        <p>In practice, it is not uncommon to have multiple hostnames (e.g.,
        <em>shard1.example.com, shard2.example.com</em>) resolve to the same IP
        address. The shards are CNAME DNS records pointing to the same server,
        and browser connection limits are enforced with respect to the
        hostname, not the IP. Alternatively, the shards could point to a CDN or
        any other reachable server.
      </div>

      <p>What is the formula for the optimal number of shards? Trick question,
      as there is no such simple equation. The answer depends on the number of
      resources on the page (which varies per page) and the available bandwidth
      and latency of the client’s connection (which varies per client). Hence,
      the best we can do is make an informed guess and use some fixed number of
      shards. With luck, the added complexity will translate to a net win for
      most clients.

      <p>In practice, domain sharding is often overused, resulting in tens of
      underutilized TCP streams, many of them never escaping TCP slow-start,
      and in the worst case, actually slowing down the user experience.
      Further, the costs are even higher when HTTPS must be used, due to the
      extra network roundtrips incurred by the TLS handshake. A few
      considerations to keep in mind:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Get the most out of TCP first; see <a data-type="xref" href=
          "/building-blocks-of-tcp/#optimizing-for-tcp">Optimizing for TCP</a>.

        <li>
          <p>The browser will automatically open up to six connections on your
          behalf.

        <li>
          <p>Number, size, and response time of each resource will affect the
          optimal number of shards.

        <li>
          <p>Client latency and bandwidth will affect the optimal number of
          shards.

        <li>
          <p>Domain sharding can hurt performance due to additional DNS lookups
          and TCP slow-start.
        </ul>

      <p>Domain sharding is a legitimate but also an imperfect optimization.
      Always begin with the minimum number of shards (none), and then carefully
      increase the number and measure the impact on your application metrics.
      In practice, very few sites actually benefit from more than a dozen
      connections, and if you do find yourself at the top end of that range,
      then you may see a much larger benefit by reducing the number of
      resources or consolidating them into fewer requests.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-w8ulH4iZ">
        <p>The extra overhead of DNS lookups and TCP slow-start affects

      "anchor">§</a>Measuring and Controlling Protocol Overhead</h2>

      <p>HTTP 0.9 started with a simple, one-line ASCII request to fetch a
      hypertext document, which incurred minimal overhead. HTTP/1.0 extended
      the protocol by adding the notion of request and response headers to
      allow both sides to exchange additional request and response metadata.
      Finally, HTTP/1.1 made this format a standard: headers are easily
      extensible by any server or client and are always sent as plain text to
      remain compatible with previous versions of HTTP.

      <p>Today, each browser-initiated HTTP request will carry an additional
      500–800 bytes of HTTP metadata: user-agent string, accept and transfer
      headers that rarely change, caching directives, and so on. Even worse,
      the 500–800 bytes is optimistic, since it omits the largest offender:
      HTTP cookies, which are now commonly used for session management,
      personalization, analytics, and more. Combined, all of this uncompressed
      HTTP metadata can, and often does, add up to multiple kilobytes of
      protocol overhead for each and every HTTP request.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-76uktys1">
        <p>RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1) does not define any limit on the size of the
        HTTP headers. However, in practice, many servers and proxies will try
        to enforce either an 8 KB or a 16 KB limit.
      </div>

      <p>The growing list of HTTP headers is not bad in and of itself, as most
      headers exist for a good reason. However, the fact that all HTTP headers
      are transferred in plain text (without any compression), can lead to high
      overhead costs for each and every request, which can be a serious
      bottleneck for some applications. For example, the rise of API-driven web
      applications, which frequently communicate with compact serialized
      messages (e.g., JSON payloads) means that it is now not uncommon to see
      the HTTP overhead exceed the payload data by an order of magnitude:

      class="anchor">§</a>Concatenation and Spriting</h2>

      <p>The fastest request is a request not made. Reducing the number of
      total requests is the best performance optimization, regardless of
      protocol used or application in question. However, if eliminating the
      request is not an option, then an alternative strategy for HTTP/1.x is to
      bundle multiple resources into a single network request:

      <dl>
        <dt>Concatenation

        <dd>
          <p>Multiple JavaScript or CSS files are combined into a single
          resource.

        <dt>Spriting

        <dd>
          <p>Multiple images are combined into a larger, composite image.
        </dl>

      <p>In the case of JavaScript and CSS, we can safely concatenate multiple
      files without affecting the behavior and the execution of the code as
      long as the execution order is maintained. Similarly, multiple images can
      be combined into an "image sprite," and CSS can then be used to select
      and position the appropriate parts of the sprite within the browser
      viewport. The benefits of both of these techniques are twofold:

      <dl>
        <dt>Reduced protocol overhead

        <dd>
          <p>By combining files into a single resource, we eliminate the
          protocol overhead associated with each file, which, as we saw
          earlier, can easily add up to kilobytes of uncompressed data
          transfers.

        <dt>Application-layer pipelining

        <dd>
          <p>The net result of both techniques, as far as byte delivery is
          concerned, is the same as if HTTP pipelining was available: data from
          multiple responses is streamed back to back, eliminating extra
          network latency. Hence, we have simply moved the pipelining logic one
          layer higher and into our application.
        </dl>

      <p>Both concatenation and spriting techniques are examples of
      content-aware application layer optimizations, which can yield
      significant performance improvements by reducing the networking overhead
      costs. However, these same techniques also introduce extra application
      complexity by requiring additional preprocessing, deployment
      considerations, and code (e.g., extra CSS markup for managing sprites).
      Further, bundling multiple independent resources may also have a
      significant <em>negative impact</em> on cache performance and execution
      speed of the page.

      <p>To understand why these techniques may hurt performance, consider the
      not-unusual case of an application with a few dozen individual JavaScript
      and CSS files, all combined into two requests in a production
      environment, one for the CSS and one for the JavaScript assets:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>All resources of the same type will live under the same URL (and
          cache key).

        <li>
          <p>Combined bundle may contain resources that are not required for
          the current page.

        <li>
          <p>A single update to any one individual file will require
          invalidating and downloading the full asset bundle, resulting in high
          byte overhead costs.

        <li>
          <p>Both JavaScript and CSS are parsed and executed only when the
          transfer is finished, potentially delaying the execution speed of
          your application.
        </ul>

      <p>In practice, most web applications are not single pages but
      collections of different views, each with different resource requirements
      but also with significant overlap: common CSS, JavaScript, and images.
      Hence, combining all assets into a single bundle often results in loading
      and processing of unnecessary bytes on the wire—although this can be seen
      as a form of pre-fetching, but at the cost of slower initial startup.

      <p>Updates are an even larger problem for many applications. A single
      update to an image sprite or a combined JavaScript file may result in
      hundreds of kilobytes of new data transfers. We sacrifice modularity and
      cache granularity, which can quickly backfire if there is high churn on
      the asset, and especially if the bundle is large. If such is the case for
      your application, consider separating the "stable core," such as
      frameworks and libraries, into separate bundles.

      <p>Memory use can also become a problem. In the case of image sprites,
      the browser must decode the entire image and keep it in memory,
      regardless of the actual size of displayed area. The browser does not
      magically clip the rest of the bitmap from memory!

      <aside>
        <h4 id="calculating-image-memory-requirements"><a href=
        "#calculating-image-memory-requirements" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Calculating Image Memory Requirements</h4>

        <p>All decoded images are stored as memory-backed RGBA bitmaps within
        the browser. In turn, each RGBA image pixel requires four bytes of
        memory: one byte each for red, green, and blue channels, and one byte
        for the alpha (transparency) channel. Hence, the total memory used is
        simply <img src=
        "/assets/equations/00488afca0d76fd6e09c993be946c0f8.svg" class=
        "equation">.

        <p>As an exercise, how much memory will a 800 × 600 pixel bitmap
        require?

        <p>800 × 600 × 4 bytes = 1,920,000 bytes ≈ 1.83 MB

        <p>On resource-constrained devices, such as mobile handsets, the memory
        overhead can quickly become your new bottleneck. This is especially
        true for image-heavy applications, such as games, which often depend on
        large numbers of image assets.
      </aside>

      <p>Finally, why would the execution speed be affected? Unfortunately,
      unlike HTML processing, which is parsed incrementally as soon as the
      bytes arrive on the client, both JavaScript and CSS parsing and execution
      is held back until the entire file is downloaded—neither JavaScript nor
      CSS processing models allow incremental execution.

        <a href="#css-and-javascript-bundle-size-vs-execution-performance"
        class="anchor">§</a>CSS and JavaScript Bundle Size vs. Execution
        Performance</h4>

        <p>The larger the CSS bundle, the longer the browser will be blocked
        before it can construct the CSSOM, possibly delaying the first paint
        event of the page. Similarly, large JavaScript bundles may also
        negatively impact the execution speed of the page; small files allow
        "incremental" execution.

        <p>Unfortunately, there is no "ideal" size for a CSS or a JavaScript
        bundle. However, tests performed by the Google PageSpeed team indicate
        that 30–50 KB (compressed) is a good range to target per JavaScript
        bundle—large enough to mitigate some of the networking overhead
        associated with small individual files, but still allowing for
        incremental and tiered execution. Your results may vary based on type
        and number of scripts in use.
      </aside>

      <p>In summary, concatenation and spriting are application-layer
      optimizations for the limitations of the underlying HTTP/1.x protocol:
      lack of reliable pipelining support and high request overhead. Both
      techniques can deliver significant performance improvements when applied
      correctly, but at the cost of added application complexity and with many
      additional caveats for caching, update costs, and even speed of execution
      and rendering of the page. Apply these optimizations carefully, measure
      the results, and consider the following questions in the context of your
      own application:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Is your application blocked on many small, individual resource
          downloads?

        <li>
          <p>Can your application benefit from selectively combining some
          requests?

        <li>
          <p>Will lost cache granularity negatively affect your users?

        <li>
          <p>Will combined image assets cause high memory overhead?

        <li>
          <p>Will the time to first render suffer from delayed execution?
        </ul>

      <p>Finding the right balance among all of these criteria is an imperfect
      science.

        "#optimizing-gmail-performance" class="anchor">§</a>Optimizing Gmail
        Performance</h4>

        <p>Gmail is a JavaScript-heavy application that has always pushed the
        performance boundaries of all modern browsers. To speed up first-load
        performance, the team has tried a variety of techniques, which now
        include these:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Separating and delivering first-paint critical CSS from the rest
            of the CSS

          <li>
            <p>Separating and delivering smaller JavaScript chunks for
            incremental execution

          <li>
            <p>Custom out-of-band update mechanism, in which the client
            downloads the new JavaScript in the background and the update is
            applied on page refresh
          </ul>

        <p>The size of the Gmail userbase turns a simple JavaScript update into
        a self-inflicted DoS attack, as all open browsers update their scripts.
        Instead, Gmail preloads the updated files in the background while the
        user is interacting with the older version of the page, which allows it
        to spread the load, and also to deliver a faster experience on next
        refresh. This process is repeated one or more times each day.

        <p>Then, to further accelerate the first-load experience, the team
        inlines the critical CSS and JavaScript into the HTML document itself
        and then incrementally loads the remaining JavaScript files in chunks
        to accelerate script execution—that’s the progress bar that is shown as
        the site first loads!

      <h2 id="resource-inlining"><a href="#resource-inlining" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Resource Inlining</h2>

      <p>Resource inlining is another popular optimization that helps reduce
      the number of outbound requests by embedding the resource within the
      document itself: JavaScript and CSS code can be included directly in the
      page via the appropriate script and style HTML blocks, and other
      resources, such as images and even audio or PDF files, can be inlined via
      the data URI scheme (<em>data:[mediatype][;base64],data</em>):

      <pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="html"
      data-highlighted="true"><code class="nt">&lt;img</code> <code class=
      "na">src=</code><code class=
      "s">"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAA</code>
<code class="s">          AAAAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="</code>
     <code class="na">alt=</code><code class=
"s">"1x1 transparent (GIF) pixel"</code> <code class="nt">/&gt;</code></pre>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-62urtgC2">
        <p>The previous example embeds a 1×1 transparent GIF pixel within the
        document, but any other MIME type, as long as the browser understands
        it, could be similarly inlined within the page: PDF, audio, video, etc.
        However, some browsers enforce a limit on the size of data URIs: IE8
        has a maximum limit of 32 KB.
      </div>

      <p>Data URIs are useful for small and ideally unique assets. When a
      resource is inlined within a page, it is by definition part of the page
      and cannot be cached individually by the browser, a CDN, or any caching
      proxy as a standalone resource. Hence, if the same resource is inlined
      across multiple pages, then the same resource will have to be transferred
      as part of each and every page, increasing the overall size of each page.
      Further, if the inlined resource is updated, then all pages on which it
      previously appeared must be invalidated and refetched by the client.

      <p>Finally, while text-based resources such as CSS and JavaScript are
      easily inlined directly into the page with no extra overhead, base64
      encoding must be used for non-text assets, which adds a significant
      overhead: 33% byte expansion as compared with the original resource!

      <div data-type="note" id="id-DZuJUxCo">
        <p>Base64 encodes any byte stream into an ASCII string via 64 ASCII
        symbols, plus whitespace. In the process, base64 expands encoded stream
        by a factor of 4/3, incurring a 33% byte overhead.
      </div>

      <p>In practice, a common rule of thumb is to consider inlining for
      resources under 1–2 KB, as resources below this threshold often incur
      higher HTTP overhead than the resource itself. However, if the inlined
      resource changes frequently, then this may lead to an unnecessarily high
      cache invalidation rate of host document: inlining is an imperfect
      science. A few criteria to consider if your application has many small,
      individual files:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If the files are small, and limited to specific pages, then
          consider inlining.

        <li>
          <p>If the small files are frequently reused across pages, then
          consider bundling.

        <li>
          <p>If the small files have high update frequency, then keep them
          separate.

        <li>
          <p>Minimize the protocol overhead by reducing the size of HTTP
          cookies.
        </ul>
