      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>High-performance browser networking relies on a host of networking
      technologies (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#optimization-layers">Figure&nbsp;13-1</a>), and the overall performance
      of our applications is the sum total of each of their parts.

      <p>We cannot control the network weather between the client and server,
      nor the client hardware or the configuration of their device, but the
      rest is in our hands: TCP and TLS optimizations on the server, and dozens
      of application optimizations to account for the peculiarities of the
      different physical layers, versions of HTTP protocol in use, as well as
      general application best practices. Granted, getting it all right is not
      an easy task, but it is a rewarding one! Let’s pull it all together.

      "anchor">§</a>Optimizing Physical and Transport Layers</h2>

      <p>The physical properties of the communication channel set hard
      performance limits on every application: speed of light and distance
      between client and server dictate the propagation latency, and the choice
      of medium (wired vs. wireless) determines the processing, transmission,
      queuing, and other delays incurred by each data packet. In fact, the
      performance of most web applications is limited by latency, not
      bandwidth, and while bandwidth speeds will continue to increase,
      unfortunately the same can’t be said for latency:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href=
          "/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#the-many-components-of-latency">The
          Many Components of Latency</a>

          "/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#delivering-higher-bandwidth-and-lower-latencies">
          Delivering Higher Bandwidth and Lower Latencies</a>

        <li>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href=
          "/primer-on-web-performance/#latency-as-a-performance-bottleneck">Latency
          as a Performance Bottleneck</a>
        </ul>

      <p>As a result, while we cannot make the bits travel any faster, it is
      crucial that we apply all the possible optimizations at the transport and
      application layers to eliminate unnecessary roundtrips, requests, and
      minimize the distance traveled by each packet—i.e., position the servers
      closer to the client.

      <p>Every application can benefit from optimizing for the unique
      properties of the physical layer in wireless networks, where latencies
      are high, and bandwidth is always at a premium. At the API layer, the
      differences between the wired and wireless networks are entirely
      transparent, but ignoring them is a recipe for poor performance. Simple
      optimizations in how and when we schedule resource downloads, beacons,
      and the rest can translate to significant impact on the experienced
      latency, battery life, and overall user experience of our applications:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href=
          "/wifi/#optimizing-for-wifi-networks">Optimizing for WiFi
          Networks</a>

          <p><a data-type="xref" href=
          "/optimizing-for-mobile-networks/">Optimizing for Mobile Networks</a>
        </ul>

      <p>Moving up the stack from the physical layer, we must ensure that each
      and every server is configured to use the latest TCP and TLS best
      practices. Optimizing the underlying protocols ensures that each client
      can get the best performance—high throughput and low latency—when
      communicating with the server:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href=
          "/building-blocks-of-tcp/#optimizing-for-tcp">Optimizing for TCP</a>

          "/transport-layer-security-tls/#optimizing-for-tls">Optimizing for
          TLS</a>
        </ul>

      <p>Finally, we arrive at the application layer. By all accounts and
      measures, HTTP is an incredibly successful protocol. After all, it is the
      common language between billions of clients and servers, enabling the
      modern Web. However, it is also an imperfect protocol, which means that
      we must take special care in how we architect our applications:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>We must work around the limitations of HTTP/1.x.

        <li>
          <p>We must leverage new performance capabilities of HTTP/2.

        <li>
          <p>We must be vigilant about applying the evergeen performance best
          practices.
        </ul>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-5guOHeUd">
        <p>The secret to a successful web performance strategy is simple:
        invest into monitoring and measurement tools to identify problems and
        regressions (see <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/primer-on-web-performance/#synthetic-and-real-user-performance-measurement">
        Synthetic and Real-User Performance Measurement</a>), link business
        goals to performance metrics, and optimize from there—i.e., treat
        performance as a feature.

      <h2 id="evergreen-performance-best-practices"><a href=
      "#evergreen-performance-best-practices" class="anchor">§</a>Evergreen
      Performance Best Practices</h2>

      <p>Regardless of the type of network or the type or version of the
      networking protocols in use, all applications should always seek to
      eliminate or reduce unnecessary network latency and minimize the number
      of transferred bytes. These two simple rules are the foundation for all
      of the evergreen performance best practices:

      <dl>
        <dt>Reduce DNS lookups

        <dd>
          <p>Every hostname resolution requires a network roundtrip, imposing
          latency on the request and blocking the request while the lookup is
          in progress.

        <dt>Reuse TCP connections

        <dd>
          <p>Leverage connection keepalive whenever possible to eliminate the
          TCP handshake and slow-start latency overhead; see <a data-type=
          "xref" href="/building-blocks-of-tcp/#slow-start">Slow-Start</a>.

        <dt>Minimize number of HTTP redirects

        <dd>
          <p>HTTP redirects impose high latency overhead—e.g., a single
          redirect to a different origin can result in DNS, TCP, TLS, and
          request-response roundtrips that can add hundreds to thousands of
          milliseconds of delay. The optimal number of redirects is zero.

        <dt>Reduce roundtrip times

        <dd>
          <p>Locating servers closer to the user improves protocol performance
          by reducing roundtrip times (e.g., faster TCP and TLS handshakes),
          and improves the transfer throughput of static and dynamic content;
          see <a data-type="xref" href=
          "/transport-layer-security-tls/#uncached-origin-fetch">Uncached
          Origin Fetch</a>.

        <dt>Eliminate unnecessary resources

        <dd>
          <p>No request is faster than a request not made. Be vigilant about
          auditing and removing unnecessary resources.
        </dl>

      <p>By this point, all of these recommendations should require no
      explanation: latency is the bottleneck, and the fastest byte is a byte
      not sent. However, HTTP provides some additional mechanisms, such as
      caching and compression, as well as its set of version-specific
      performance quirks:

      <dl>
        <dt>Cache resources on the client

        <dd>
          <p>Application resources should be cached to avoid re-requesting the
          same bytes each time the resources are required.

        <dt>Compress assets during transfer

        <dd>
          <p>Application resources should be transferred with the minimum
          number of bytes: always apply the best compression method for each
          transferred asset.

        <dt>Eliminate unnecessary request bytes

        <dd>
          <p>Reducing the transferred HTTP header data (e.g., HTTP cookies) can
          save entire roundtrips of network latency.

        <dt>Parallelize request and response processing

        <dd>
          <p>Request and response queuing latency, both on the client and
          server, often goes unnoticed, but contributes significant and
          unnecessary latency delays.

        <dt>Apply protocol-specific optimizations

        <dd>
          <p>HTTP/1.x offers limited parallelism, which requires that we bundle
          resources, split delivery across domains, and more. By contrast,
          HTTP/2 performs best when a single connection is used, and HTTP/1.x
          specific optimizations are removed.
        </dl>

      <p>Each of these warrants closer examination. Let’s dive in.

      <section>
        <h3 id="cache-resources-on-the-client"><a href=
        "#cache-resources-on-the-client" class="anchor">§</a>Cache Resources on
        the Client</h3>

        <p>The fastest network request is a request not made. Maintaining a
        cache of previously downloaded data allows the client to use a local
        copy of the resource, thereby eliminating the request. For resources
        delivered over HTTP, make sure the appropriate cache headers are in
        place:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><code>Cache-Control</code> header can specify the cache lifetime
            (max-age) of the resource.

          <li>
            <p><code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>ETag</code> headers provide
            validation mechanisms.
          </ul>

        <p>Whenever possible, you should specify an explicit cache lifetime for
        each resource, which allows the client to use a local copy, instead of
        re-requesting the same object all the time. Similarly, specify a
        validation mechanism to allow the client to check if the expired
        resource has been updated: if the resource has not changed, we can
        eliminate the data transfer.

        <p>Finally, note that you need to specify both the cache lifetime and
        the validation method! A common mistake is to provide only one of the
        two, which results in either redundant transfers of resources that have
        not changed (i.e., missing validation), or redundant validation checks
        each time the resource is used (i.e., missing or unnecessarily short
        cache lifetime).

        <div data-type="note" id="id-xduaCbtgCV">
          <p>For hands-on advice on optimizing your caching strategy, see the

          "anchor">§</a>Web Caching on Smartphones: Ideal vs. Reality</h4>

          <p>Caching of HTTP resources has been one of the top performance
          optimizations ever since the very early versions of the HTTP
          protocol. However, while seemingly everyone is aware of its benefits,
          real-world studies continue to discover that it is nonetheless an
          often-omitted optimization! A recent joint study by AT&amp;T Labs
          Research and University of Michigan reports:

          <blockquote>
            <p>Our findings suggest that redundant transfers contribute 18% and
            20% of the total HTTP traffic volume in the two datasets. Also they
            are responsible for 17% of the bytes, 7% of the radio energy
            consumption, 6% of the signaling load, and 9% of the radio resource
            utilization of all cellular data traffic in the second dataset.
            Most of such redundant transfers are caused by the smartphone web
            caching implementation that does not fully support or strictly
            follow the protocol specification, or by developers not fully
            utilizing the caching support provided by the libraries.

            <p data-type="attribution">Web Caching on Smartphones,
            <cite>MobiSys 2012</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Is your application fetching unnecessary resources over and over
          again? As evidence shows, that’s not a rhetorical question.
          Double-check your application and, even better, add some tests to
          catch any regressions in the future.

      <section>
        <h3 id="compress-transferred-data"><a href="#compress-transferred-data"
        class="anchor">§</a>Compress Transferred Data</h3>

        <p>Leveraging a local cache allows the client to avoid fetching
        duplicate content on each request. However, if and when the resource
        must be fetched, either because it has expired, it is new, or it cannot
        be cached, then it should be transferred with the minimum number of
        bytes. Always apply the best compression method for each asset.

        <p>The size of text-based assets, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        can be reduced by 60%–80% on average when compressed with Gzip. Images,
        on the other hand, require more nuanced consideration:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Images often carry a lot of metadata that can be stripped—e.g.,
            EXIF.

          <li>
            <p>Images should be sized to their display width to minimize
            transferred bytes.

          <li>
            <p>Images can be compressed with different lossy and lossless
            formats.
          </ul>

        <p>Images account for over half of the transferred bytes of an average
        page, which makes them a high-value optimization target: the simple
        choice of an optimal image format can yield dramatically improved
        compression ratios; lossy compression methods can reduce transfer sizes
        by orders of magnitude; sizing the image to its display width will
        reduce both the transfer and memory footprints (see <a data-type="xref"
        href="/http1x/#calculating-image-memory-requirements">Calculating Image
        Memory Requirements</a>) on the client. Invest into tools and
        automation to optimize image delivery on your site.

        Unnecessary Request Bytes</h3>

        <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that the server is not
        required to retain any information about the client between different
        requests. However, many applications require state for session
        management, personalization, analytics, and more. To enable this
        functionality, the HTTP State Management Mechanism (RFC 2965) extension
        allows any website to associate and update "cookie" metadata for its
        origin: the provided data is saved by the browser and is then
        automatically appended onto every request to the origin within the
        <code>Cookie</code> header.

        <p>The standard does not specify a maximum limit on the size of a
        cookie, but in practice most browsers enforce a 4 KB limit. However,
        the standard also allows the site to associate many cookies per origin.
        As a result, it is possible to associate tens to hundreds of kilobytes
        of arbitrary metadata, split across multiple cookies, for each origin!

        <p>Needless to say, this can have significant performance implications
        for your application. Associated cookie data is automatically sent by
        the browser on each request, which, in the worst case can add entire
        roundtrips of network latency by exceeding the initial TCP congestion
        window, regardless of whether HTTP/1.x or HTTP/2 is used:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>In HTTP/1.x, all HTTP headers, including cookies, are
            transferred uncompressed on each request.

          <li>
            <p>In HTTP/2, headers are compressed with HPACK, but at a minimum
            the cookie value is transferred on the first request, which will
            affect the performance of your initial page load.
          </ul>

        <p>Cookie size should be monitored judiciously: transfer the minimum
        amount of required data, such as a secure session token, and leverage a
        shared session cache on the server to look up other metadata. And even
        better, eliminate cookies entirely wherever possible—chances are, you
        do not need client-specific metadata when requesting static assets,
        such as images, scripts, and stylesheets.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-3GumtbcZC3">
          <p>When using HTTP/1.x, a common best practice is to designate a
          dedicated "cookie-free" origin, which can be used to deliver
          responses that do not need client-specific optimization.

        "#parallelize-request-and-response-processing" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Parallelize Request and Response Processing</h3>

        <p>To achieve the fastest response times within your application, all
        resource requests should be dispatched as soon as possible. However,
        another important point to consider is how these requests will be
        processed on the server. After all, if all of our requests are then
        serially queued by the server, then we are once again incurring
        unnecessary latency. Here’s how to get the best performance:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Reuse TCP connections by optimizing connection keepalive
            timeouts.

          <li>
            <p>Use multiple HTTP/1.1 connections where necessary for parallel
            downloads.

          <li>
            <p>Upgrade to HTTP/2 to enable multiplexing and best performance.

          <li>
            <p>Allocate sufficient server resources to process requests in
            parallel.
          </ul>

        <p>Without connection keepalive, a new TCP connection is required for
        each HTTP request, which incurs significant overhead due to the TCP
        handshake and slow-start. Make sure to identify and optimize your
        server and proxy connection timeouts to avoid closing the connection
        prematurely. With that in place, and to get the best performance, use
        HTTP/2 to allow the client and server to reuse the same connection for
        all requests. If HTTP/2 is not an option, use multiple TCP connections
        to achieve request parallelism with HTTP/1.x.

        <p>Identifying the sources of unnecessary client and server latency is
        both an art and science: examine the client resource waterfall (see
        <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/primer-on-web-performance/#analyzing-the-resource-waterfall">Analyzing
        the Resource Waterfall</a>), as well as your server logs. Common
        pitfalls often include the following:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Blocking resources on the client forcing delayed resource
            fetches; see <a data-type="xref" href=
            "/primer-on-web-performance/#dom-cssom-and-javascript">DOM, CSSOM,
            and JavaScript</a>.

          <li>
            <p>Underprovisioned proxy and load balancer capacity, forcing
            delayed delivery of the requests (queuing latency) to the
            application servers.

          <li>
            <p>Underprovisioned servers, forcing slow execution and other
            processing delays.

          <p>The browser will automatically determine the optimal loading order
          for each resource in the document, and we can both assist and hinder
          the browser in this process:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>We can provide hints to assist the browser; see <a data-type=

              Optimization</a>.

            <li>
              <p>We can hinder by hiding resources from the browser.
            </ul>

          <p>Modern browsers are designed to scan the contents of HTML and CSS
          files as efficiently and as soon as possible. However, the document
          parser is also frequently blocked while waiting for a script or other
          blocking resources to download before it can proceed. During this
          time, the browser uses a "preload scanner," which speculatively looks
          ahead in the source for resource downloads that could be dispatched
          early to reduce overall latency.

          <p>Note that the use of the preload scanner is a speculative
          optimization, and it is used only when the document parser is
          blocked. However, in practice, it yields significant benefits: based
          on experimental data with Google Chrome, it offers a ~20% improvement
          in page loading times and rendering speeds!

          <p>Unfortunately, these optimizations do not apply for resources that
          are scheduled via JavaScript; the preload scanner cannot
          speculatively execute scripts. As a result, moving resource
          scheduling logic into scripts may offer the benefit of more granular
          control to the application, but in doing so, it will hide the
          resource from the preload scanner, a trade-off that warrants close
          examination.

      <p>The order in which we optimize HTTP/1.x deployments is important:
      configure servers to deliver the best possible TCP and TLS performance,
      and then carefully review and apply mobile and evergreen application best
      practices: measure, iterate.

      <p>With the evergreen optimizations in place, and with good performance
      instrumentation within the application, evaluate whether the application
      can benefit from applying HTTP/1.x specific optimizations (read,
      <em>protocol workarounds</em>):

      <dl>
        <dt>Leverage HTTP pipelining

        <dt>Bundle resources to reduce HTTP requests

        <dd>
          <p>Techniques such as concatenation and spriting can both help

      <p>Pipelining has limited support, and each of the remaining
      optimizations comes with its set of benefits and trade-offs. In fact, it
      is often overlooked that each of these techniques can hurt performance
      when applied aggressively, or incorrectly; review <a data-type="xref"

      <p>HTTP/2 enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced
      latency by enabling request and response multiplexing, header
      compression, prioritization, and more—see <a data-type="xref" href=
      "/http2/#design-and-technical-goals">Design and Technical Goals</a>.
      Getting the best performance out of HTTP/2, especially in light of the
      one-connection-per-origin model, requires a well-tuned server network
      stack. Review <a data-type="xref" href=

      <p>Next up—surprise—apply the evergreen application best practices: send
      fewer bytes, eliminate requests, and adapt resource scheduling for
      wireless networks. Reducing the amount of data transferred and
      eliminating unnecessary network latency are the best optimizations for
      any application, web or native, regardless of the version or type of the
      application and transport protocols in use.

      <p>Finally, undo and unlearn the bad habits of domain sharding,
      concatenation, and image spriting. With HTTP/2 we are no longer
      constrained by limited parallelism: requests are cheap, and both requests
      and responses can be multiplexed efficiently. These workarounds are no
      longer necessary and omitting them can improve performance.

      <section>
        <h3 id="eliminate-domain-sharding"><a href="#eliminate-domain-sharding"
        class="anchor">§</a>Eliminate Domain Sharding</h3>

        <p>HTTP/2 achieves the best performance by multiplexing requests over
        the same TCP connection, which enables effective request and response
        prioritization, flow control, and header compression. As a result, the
        optimal number of connections is exactly one and domain sharding is an
        anti-pattern.

        <p>HTTP/2 also provides a TLS connection-coalescing mechanism that
        allows the client to coalesce requests from different origins and
        dispatch them over the same connection when the following conditions
        are satisfied:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The origins are covered by the same TLS certificate—e.g., a
            wildcard certificate, or a certificate with matching "Subject
            Alternative Names."

          <li>
            <p>The origins resolve to the same server IP address.
          </ul>

        <p>For example, if <code>example.com</code> provides a wildcard TLS
        certificate that is valid for all of its subdomains (i.e.,
        <code>*.example.com</code>) and references an asset on
        <code>static.example.com</code> that resolves to the same server IP
        address as <code>example.com</code>, then the HTTP/2 client is allowed
        to reuse the same TCP connection to fetch resources from
        <code>example.com</code> and <code>static.example.com</code>.

        <p>An interesting side effect of HTTP/2 connection coalescing is that
        it enables an HTTP/1.x friendly deployment model: some assets can be
        served from alternate origins, which enables higher parallelism for
        HTTP/1 clients, and if those same origins satisfy the above criteria
        then the HTTP/2 clients can coalesce requests and reuse the same
        connection. Alternatively, the application can be more hands-on and
        inspect the negotiated protocol and deliver alternate resources for
        each client: with sharded asset references for HTTP/1.x clients and
        with same-origin asset references for HTTP/2 clients.

        <p>Depending on the architecture of your application you may be able to
        rely on connection coalescing, you may need to serve alternate markup,
        or you may use both techniques as necessary to provide the optimal
        HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 experience. Alternatively, you might consider
        focusing on optimizing HTTP/2 performance only; the client adoption is
        growing rapidly, and the extra complexity of optimizing for both
        protocols may be unnecessary.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-n4uBsrUgsd">
          <p>Due to third-party dependencies it may not be possible to fetch
          all the resources via the same TCP connection—that’s OK. Seek to

        <p>Bundling multiple assets into a single response was a critical
        optimization for HTTP/1.x where limited parallelism and high protocol
        overhead typically outweighed all other concerns—see <a data-type=
        "xref" href="/http1x/#concatenation-and-spriting">Concatenation and
        Spriting</a>. However, with HTTP/2, multiplexing is no longer an issue,
        and header compression dramatically reduces the metadata overhead of
        each HTTP request. As a result, we need to reconsider the use of
        concatenation and spriting in light of its new pros and cons:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Bundled resources may result in unnecessary data transfers: the
            user might not need all the assets on a particular page, or at all.

          <li>
            <p>Bundled resources may result in expensive cache invalidations: a
            single updated byte in one component forces a full fetch of the
            entire bundle.

          <li>
            <p>Bundled resources may delay execution: many content-types cannot
            be processed and applied until the entire response is transferred.

          <li>
            <p>Bundled resources may require additional infrastructure at build
            or delivery time to generate the associated bundle.

          <li>
            <p>Bundled resources may provide better compression if the
            resources contain similar content.
          </ul>

        <p>In practice, while HTTP/1.x provides the mechanisms for granular
        cache management of each resource, the limited parallelism forced us to
        bundle resources together. The latency penalty of delayed fetches
        outweighed the costs of decreased effectiveness of caching, more
        frequent and more expensive invalidations, and delayed execution.

        <p>HTTP/2 removes this unfortunate trade-off by providing support for
        request and response multiplexing, which means that we can now optimize
        our applications by delivering more granular resources: each resource
        can have an optimized caching policy (expiry time and revalidation
        token) and be individually updated without invalidating other resources
        in the bundle. In short, HTTP/2 enables our applications to make better
        use of the HTTP cache.

        <p>That said, HTTP/2 does not eliminate the utility of concatenation
        and spriting entirely. A few additional considerations to keep in mind:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Files that contain similar data may achieve better compression
            when bundled.

          <li>
            <p>Each resource request carries some overhead, both when reading
            from cache (I/O requests), and from the network (I/O requests,
            on-the-wire metadata, and server processing).
          </ul>

        <p>There is no single optimal strategy for all applications: delivering
        a single large bundle is unlikely to yield best results, and issuing
        hundreds of requests for small resources may not be the optimal
        strategy either. The right trade-off will depend on the type of
        content, frequency of updates, access patterns, and other criteria. To
        get the best results, gather measurement data for your own application
        and optimize accordingly.

        <h3 id="eliminate-roundtrips-with-server-push"><a href=
        "#eliminate-roundtrips-with-server-push" class="anchor">§</a>Eliminate
        Roundtrips with Server Push</h3>

        <p>Server push is a powerful new feature of HTTP/2 that enables the
        server to send multiple responses for a single client request. That
        said, recall that the use of resource inlining (e.g., embedding an
        image into an HTML document via a data URI) is, in fact, a form of
        application-layer server push. As such, while this is not an entirely
        new capability for web developers, the use of HTTP/2 server push offers
        many performance benefits over inlining: pushed resources can be cached
        individually, reused across pages, canceled by the client, and more—see
        <a data-type="xref" href="/http2/#server-push">Server Push</a>.

        <p>With HTTP/2 there is no longer a reason to inline resources just
        because they are small; we’re no longer constrained by the lack of
        parallelism and request overhead is very low. As a result, server push
        acts as a latency optimization that removes a full request-response
        roundtrip between the client and server—e.g., if, after sending a
        particular response, we know that the client will always come back and
        request a specific subresource, we can eliminate the roundtrip by
        pushing the subresource to the client.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-xduJfbtJsV">
          <p>If the client does not support, or disables the use of server
          push, it will initiate the request for the same resource on its
          own—i.e., server push is a safe and transparent latency optimization.
        </div>

        <p>Critical resources that block page construction and rendering (see
        <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/primer-on-web-performance/#dom-cssom-and-javascript">DOM, CSSOM, and
        JavaScript</a>) are prime candidates for the use of server push, as
        they are often known or can be specified upfront. Eliminating a full
        roundtrip from the critical path can yield savings of tens to hundreds
        of milliseconds, especially for users on mobile networks where
        latencies are often both high and highly variable.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Server push, as its name indicates, is initiated by the server.
            However, the client can control how and where it is used by
            indicating to the server the maximum number of pushed streams that
            can be initiated in parallel by the server, as well as the amount
            of data that can be sent on each stream before it is acknowledged
            by the client. This allows the client to limit, or outright
            disable, the use of server push—e.g., if the user is on an
            expensive network and wants to minimize the number of transferred
            bytes, they may be willing to disable the latency optimization in
            favor of explicit control over what is fetched.

          <li>
            <p>Server push is subject to same-origin restrictions; the server
            initiating the push must be authoritative for the content and is
            not allowed to push arbitrary third-party content to the client.
            Consolidate your resources under the same origin (i.e., eliminate
            domain sharding) to enable more opportunities to leverage server
            push.

          <li>
            <p>Server push responses are processed in the same way as responses
            received in reply to a browser-initiated requests—i.e., they can be
            cached and reused across multiple pages and navigations! Leverage
            this to avoid having to duplicate the same content across different
            pages and navigations.
          </ul>

        <p>Note that even the most naive server push strategy that opts to push
        assets regardless of their caching policy is, in effect, equivalent to
        inlining: the resource is duplicated on each page and transferred each
        time the parent resource is requested. However, even there, server push
        offers important performance benefits: the pushed response can be
        prioritized more effectively, it affords more control to the client,
        and it provides an upgrade path towards implementing much smarter
        strategies that leverage caching and other mechanisms that can
        eliminate redundant transfers. In short, if your application is using
        inlining, then you should consider replacing it with server push.

          Push</h4>

          <p>How does the server determine which resources should be delivered
          via server push? The HTTP/2 standard does not specify any particular
          algorithm, and the server is free to implement custom strategies for
          each application.

          <p>For example, server-side application code can specify which
          resources should be pushed and when. This strategy requires explicit
          configuration but provides full control to the application developer.
          Alternatively, the server can learn the associated resources based on
          observed traffic patterns (e.g., by observing <code>Referrer</code>
          headers) and automatically initiate server push for related
          resources; use some mechanism to track or guess client’s cache state
          and initiate push for missing resources; and so on.

          <p>Server push enables many new and previously not possible
          optimization opportunities. Check the documentation of your HTTP/2
          server for how to enable, configure, and deploy the use of server
          push for your application.

        <p>A naive implementation of an HTTP/2 server, or proxy, may "speak"
        the protocol, but without well implemented support for features such as
        flow control and request prioritization, it can easily yield less that
        optimal performance. For example, it might saturate the user’s
        bandwidth by sending large low priority resources (such as images),
        while the browser is blocked from rendering the page until it receives
        higher priority resources (such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript).

        <p>With HTTP/2 the client places a lot of trust on the server. To get
        the best performance, an HTTP/2 client has to be "optimistic": it
        annotates requests with priority information (see <a data-type="xref"
        href="/http2/#stream-prioritization">Stream Prioritization</a>) and
        dispatches them to the server as soon as possible; it relies on the
        server to use the communicated dependencies and weights to optimize
        delivery of each response. A well-optimized HTTP server has always been
        important, but with HTTP/2 the server takes on additional and critical
        responsibilities that, previously, were out of scope.

        <p>Do your due diligence when testing and deploying your HTTP/2
        infrastructure. Common benchmarks measuring server throughput and
        requests per second do not capture these new requirements and may not
        be representative of the actual experience as seen by your users when
        loading your application.

          class="anchor">§</a>Optimizing Response Delivery with Request
          Prioritization</h4>

          <p>The purpose of request prioritization is to allow the client to
          express how it would prefer the server to deliver responses when
          there is limited capacity—e.g., the server may be ready to send
          multiple responses, but due to limited bandwidth it should prioritize
          sending some resources ahead of others.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>What if the server disregards all priority information?

            <li>
              <p>Should higher-priority streams always take precedence?

            <li>
              <p>Are there cases where different priority streams should be
              interleaved?
            </ul>

          <p>If the server disregards all priority information, then it runs
          the risk of causing unnecessary processing delays for the
          client—e.g., block the browser from rendering the page by sending
          images ahead of more critical CSS and JavaScript resources. However,
          delivering streams in a strict dependency order can also yield
          suboptimal performance as it may reintroduce the head-of-line
          blocking problem where a high priority but slow response may
          unnecessarily block delivery of other resources. As a result, a
          well-implemented server should give precedence to high priority
          streams, but it should also interleave lower priority streams if all
          higher priority streams are blocked.
