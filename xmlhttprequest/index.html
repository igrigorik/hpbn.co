      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a browser-level API that enables the client to
      script data transfers via JavaScript. XHR made its first debut in
      Internet Explorer 5, became one of the key technologies behind the
      Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) revolution, and is now a
      fundamental building block of nearly every modern web application.

      <blockquote>
        <p>XMLHTTP changed everything. It put the "D" in DHTML. It allowed us
        to asynchronously get data from the server and preserve document state
        on the client… The Outlook Web Access (OWA) team’s desire to build a
        rich Win32 like application in a browser pushed the technology into IE
        that allowed AJAX to become a reality.

        <p data-type="attribution">Jim Van Eaton, <cite>Outlook Web Access: A
        catalyst for web evolution</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Prior to XHR, the web page had to be refreshed to send or fetch any
      state updates between the client and server. With XHR, this workflow
      could be done asynchronously and under full control of the application
      JavaScript code. XHR is what enabled us to make the leap from building
      pages to building interactive web applications in the browser.

      <p>However, the power of XHR is not only that it enabled asynchronous
      communication within the browser, but also that it made it simple. XHR is
      an application API provided by the browser, which is to say that the
      browser automatically takes care of all the low-level connection
      management, protocol negotiation, formatting of HTTP requests, and much
      more:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The browser manages connection establishment, pooling, and
          termination.

        <li>
          <p>The browser determines the best HTTP(S) transport (HTTP/1.0, 1.1,
          2).

        <li>
          <p>The browser handles HTTP caching, redirects, and content-type
          negotiation.

        <li>
          <p>The browser enforces security, authentication, and privacy
          constraints.

        <li>
          <p><em>And more…</em>
        </ul>

      <p>Free from worrying about all the low-level details, our applications
      can focus on the business logic of initiating requests, managing their
      progress, and processing returned data from the server. The combination
      of a simple API and its ubiquitous availability across all the browsers
      makes XHR the "Swiss Army knife" of networking in the browser.

      <p>As a result, nearly every networking use case (scripted downloads,
      uploads, streaming, and even real-time notifications) can and have been
      built on top of XHR. Of course, this doesn’t mean that XHR is the most
      efficient transport in each case—in fact, as we will see, far from it—but
      it is nonetheless often used as a fallback transport for older clients,
      which may not have access to newer browser networking APIs. With that in
      mind, let’s take a closer look at the latest capabilities of XHR, its use
      cases, and performance do’s and don’ts.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-zqCdTK">
        <p>An exhaustive analysis of the full XHR API and its capabilities is
        outside the scope of our discussion—our focus is on performance! Refer
        to the official W3C standard for an overview of the <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XMLHttpRequest API</a>.

    <section>
      <h2 id="brief-history-of-xhr"><a href="#brief-history-of-xhr" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Brief History of XHR</h2>

      <p>Despite its name, XHR was never intended to be tied to XML
      specifically. The XML prefix is a vestige of a decision to ship the first
      version of what became known as XHR as part of the MSXML library in
      Internet Explorer 5:

      <blockquote>
        <p>This was the good-old-days when critical features were crammed in
        just days before a release…I realized that the MSXML library shipped
        with IE and I had some good contacts over in the XML team who would
        probably help out—I got in touch with Jean Paoli who was running that
        team at the time and we pretty quickly struck a deal to ship the thing
        as part of the MSXML library. Which is the real explanation of where
        the name XMLHTTP comes from—the thing is mostly about HTTP and doesn’t
        have any specific tie to XML other than that was the easiest excuse for
        shipping it so I needed to cram XML into the name.

        <p data-type="attribution">Alex Hopmann, <cite>The story of
        XMLHTTP</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Mozilla modeled its own implementation of XHR against Microsoft’s and
      exposed it via the XMLHttpRequest interface. Safari, Opera, and other
      browsers followed, and XHR became a de facto standard in all major
      browsers—hence the name and why it stuck. In fact, the official W3C
      Working Draft specification for XHR was only published in 2006, well
      after XHR came into widespread use!

      <p>However, despite its popularity and key role in the AJAX revolution,
      the early versions of XHR provided limited capabilities: text-based-only
      data transfers, restricted support for handling uploads, and inability to
      handle cross-domain requests. To address these shortcomings, the
      "XMLHttpRequest Level 2" draft was published in 2008, which added a
      number of new features:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Support for request timeouts

        <li>
          <p>Support for binary and text-based data transfers

        <li>
          <p>Support for application override of media type and encoding of
          responses

        <li>
          <p>Support for monitoring progress events of each request

        <li>
          <p>Support for efficient file uploads

        <li>
          <p>Support for safe cross-origin requests
        </ul>

      <p>In 2011, "XMLHttpRequest Level 2" specification was merged with the
      original XMLHttpRequest working draft. Hence, while you will often find
      references to XHR version or level 1 and 2, these distinctions are no
      longer relevant; today, there is only one, unified XHR specification. In
      fact, all the new XHR2 features and capabilities are offered via the same
      XMLHttpRequest API: same interface, more features.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-WaCyuLCq">
        <p>New XHR2 features are now supported by all the modern browsers; see
        <a href="http://caniuse.com/xhr2">caniuse.com/xhr2</a>. Hence, whenever
        we refer to XHR, we are implicitly referring to the XHR2 standard.

      <h2 id="cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors"><a href=
      "#cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors" class="anchor">§</a>Cross-Origin
      Resource Sharing (CORS)</h2>

      <p>XHR is a browser-level API that automatically handles myriad low-level
      details such as caching, handling redirects, content negotiation,
      authentication, and much more. This serves a dual purpose. First, it
      makes the application APIs much easier to work with, allowing us to focus
      on the business logic. But, second, it allows the browser to sandbox and
      enforce a set of security and policy constraints on the application code.

      <p>The XHR interface enforces strict HTTP semantics on each request: the
      application supplies the data and URL, and the browser formats the
      request and handles the full lifecycle of each connection. Similarly,
      while the XHR API allows the application to add custom HTTP headers (via
      the <code>setRequestHeader()</code> method), there are a number of
      protected headers that are off-limits to application code:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Access-Control-*

        <li>
          <p>Host, Upgrade, Connection, Referer, Origin

        <li>
          <p>Cookie, Sec-*, Proxy-*, and a dozen others…
        </ul>

      <p>The browser will refuse to override any of the unsafe headers, which
      guarantees that the application cannot impersonate a fake user-agent,
      user, or the origin from where the request is being made. In fact,
      protecting the origin header is especially important, as it is the key
      piece of the "same-origin policy" applied to all XHR requests.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-adCwhycQ">
        <p>An "origin" is defined as a triple of application protocol, domain
        name, and port number—e.g., (http, example.com, 80) and (https,
        example.com, 443) are considered as different origins. For more details
        see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-abarth-origin">The Web
        Origin Concept</a>.
      </div>

      <p>The motivation for the same-origin policy is simple: the browser
      stores user data, such as authentication tokens, cookies, and other
      private metadata, which cannot be leaked across different
      applications—e.g., without the same origin sandbox an arbitrary script on
      <em>example.com</em> could access and manipulate users’ data on
      <em>thirdparty.com</em>!

      <p>To address this specific problem, early versions of XHR were
      restricted to same-origin requests only, where the requesting origin had
      to match the origin of the requested resource: an XHR initiated from
      <em>example.com</em> could request another resource only from the same
      <em>example.com</em> origin. Alternatively, if the same origin
      precondition failed, then the browser would simply refuse to initiate the
      XHR request and raise an error.

      <p>However, while necessary, the same-origin policy also places severe
      restrictions on the usefulness of XHR: what if the server wants to offer
      a resource to a script running in a different origin? That’s where
      "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" (CORS) comes in! CORS provides a secure
      opt-in mechanism for client-side cross-origin requests:

      <div data-type="example" id="-GBCwC6ce">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">
// script origin: (http, example.com, 80)
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', '/resource.js'); <a class="counter" id="xhrreq-co" href=
"#xhrreq"></a>
xhr.onload = function() { ... };
xhr.send();

var cors_xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
cors_xhr.open('GET', 'http://thirdparty.com/resource.js'); <a class="counter"
id="xhrcorsreq-co" href="#xhrcorsreq"></a>
cors_xhr.onload = function() { ... };
cors_xhr.send();
</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="xhrreq" href="#xhrreq-co"></a>

            <p>Same-origin XHR request

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="xhrcorsreq" href="#xhrcorsreq-co"></a>

            <p>Cross-origin XHR request
          </ol>
      </div>

      <p>CORS requests use the same XHR API, with the only difference that the
      URL to the requested resource is associated with a different origin from
      where the script is being executed: in the previous example, the script
      is executed from <em>(http, example.com, 80)</em>, and the second XHR
      request is accessing <code>resource.js</code> from <em>(http,
      thirdparty.com, 80)</em>.

      <p>The opt-in authentication mechanism for the CORS request is handled at
      a lower layer: when the request is made, the browser automatically
      appends the protected <em>Origin</em> HTTP header, which advertises the
      origin from where the request is being made. In turn, the remote server
      is then able to examine the <em>Origin</em> header and decide if it
      should allow the request by returning an
      <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> header in its response:

      <div data-type="example" id="-DKCRf9cL">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">
=&gt; Request
GET /resource.js HTTP/1.1
Host: thirdparty.com
Origin: http://example.com <a class="counter" id="origin-co" href=
"#origin"></a>
...

&lt;= Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com <a class="counter" id="acao-co"
href="#acao"></a>
...
</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="origin" href="#origin-co"></a>

            <p>Origin header is automatically set by the browser.

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="acao" href="#acao-co"></a>

            <p>Opt-in header is set by the server.
          </ol>
      </div>

      <p>In the preceding example, <em>thirdparty.com</em> decided to opt into
      cross-origin resource sharing with <em>example.com</em> by returning an
      appropriate access control header in its response. Alternatively, if it
      wanted to disallow access, it could simply omit the
      <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> header, and the client’s browser
      would automatically fail the sent request.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-eoCOs1c0">
        <p>If the third-party server is not CORS aware, then the client request
        will fail, as the client always verifies the presence of the opt-in
        header. As a special case, CORS also allows the server to return a
        wildcard (<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>) to indicate that
        it allows access from any origin. However, think twice before enabling
        this policy!
      </div>

      <p>With that, we are all done, right? Turns out, not quite, as CORS takes
      a number of additional security precautions to ensure that the server is
      CORS aware:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>CORS requests omit user credentials such as cookies and HTTP
          authentication.

        <li>
          <p>The client is limited to issuing "simple cross-origin requests,"
          which restricts both the allowed methods (GET, POST, HEAD) and access
          to HTTP headers that can be sent and read by the XHR.
        </ul>

      <p>To enable cookies and HTTP authentication, the client must set an
      extra property (<code>withCredentials</code>) on the XHR object when
      making the request, and the server must also respond with an appropriate
      header (<em>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</em>) to indicate that it is
      knowingly allowing the application to include private user data.
      Similarly, if the client needs to write or read custom HTTP headers or
      wants to use a "non-simple method" for the request, then it must first
      ask for permission from the third-party server by issuing a preflight
      request:

      <div data-type="example" id="-OlCKFocq">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">
=&gt; Preflight request
OPTIONS /resource.js HTTP/1.1 <a class="counter" id="preflight-co" href=
"#preflight"></a>
Host: thirdparty.com
Origin: http://example.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: My-Custom-Header
...

&lt;= Preflight response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK <a class="counter" id="pre-response-co" href=
"#pre-response"></a>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: My-Custom-Header
...

(actual HTTP request) <a class="counter" id="corsreq-co" href="#corsreq"></a>

</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="preflight" href="#preflight-co"></a>

            <p>Preflight OPTIONS request to verify permissions

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="pre-response" href="#pre-response-co"></a>

            <p>Successful preflight response from third-party origin

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="corsreq" href="#corsreq-co"></a>

            <p>Actual CORS request
          </ol>
      </div>

      <p>The official W3C CORS specification defines when and where a preflight
      request must be used: "simple" requests can skip it, but there are a
      variety of conditions that will trigger it and add a minimum of a full
      roundtrip of network latency to verify permissions. The good news is,
      once a preflight request is made, it can be cached by the client to avoid
      the same verification on each request.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-PzCeSgcE">
        <p>CORS is supported by all modern browsers; see <a href=

      class="anchor">§</a>Downloading Data with XHR</h2>

      <p>XHR can transfer both text-based and binary data. In fact, the browser
      offers automatic encoding and decoding for a variety of native data
      types, which allows the application to pass these types directly to XHR
      to be properly encoded, and vice versa, for the types to be automatically
      decoded by the browser:

      <dl>
        <dt><code>ArrayBuffer</code>

        <dd>
          <p>Fixed-length binary data buffer

        <dt><code>Blob</code>

        <dd>
          <p>Binary large object of immutable data

        <dt><code>Document</code>

        <dd>
          <p>Parsed HTML or XML document

        <dt><code>JSON</code>

        <dd>
          <p>JavaScript object representing a simple data structure

        <dt><code>Text</code>

        <dd>
          <p>A simple text string
        </dl>

      <p>Either the browser can rely on the HTTP content-type negotiation to
      infer the appropriate data type (e.g., decode an
      <em>application/json</em> response into a JSON object), or the
      application can explicitly override the data type when initiating the XHR
      request:

      <p>Uploading data via XHR is just as simple and efficient for all data
      types. In fact, the code is effectively the same, with the only
      difference that we also pass in a data object when calling
      <em>send()</em> on the XHR request. The rest is handled by the browser:

      <p>The XHR <em>send()</em> method accepts one of <code>DOMString</code>,

      <code>File</code>, or <code>ArrayBuffer</code> objects, automatically
      performs the appropriate encoding, sets the appropriate HTTP
      content-type, and dispatches the request. Need to send a binary blob or
      upload a file provided by the user? Simple: grab a reference to the
      object and pass it to XHR. In fact, with a little extra work, we can also
      split a large file into smaller chunks:

      <p>XHR does not support request streaming, which means that we must
      provide the full payload when calling <em>send()</em>. However, this
      example illustrates a simple application workaround: the file is split
      and uploaded in chunks via multiple XHR requests. This implementation
      pattern is by no means a replacement for a true request streaming API,
      but it is nonetheless a viable solution for some applications.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-2aClSEfM">
        <p>Slicing large file uploads is a good technique to provide more
        robust API where connectivity is unstable or intermittent—e.g., if a

        resume the upload later instead of restarting the full transfer from
        the start.

      <p>Network connectivity can be intermittent, and latency and bandwidth
      are highly variable. So how do we know if an XHR request has succeeded,
      timed out, or failed? The XHR object provides a convenient API for
      listening to progress events (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#xhr-progress">Table&nbsp;15-1</a>), which indicate the current status
      of the request.

      <p>Each XHR transfer begins with a <em>loadstart</em> and finishes with a
      <em>loadend</em> event, and in between, one or more additional events are
      fired to indicate the status of the transfer. Hence, to monitor progress
      the application can register a set of JavaScript event listeners on the
      XHR object:

      <div data-type="example" id="-r5CRFZiz">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET','/resource');
xhr.timeout = 5000; <a class="counter" id="timeout-co" href="#timeout"></a>

    ...
  }
}

xhr.upload.addEventListener('progress', onProgressHandler); <a class="counter"
id="upload-co" href="#upload"></a>
xhr.addEventListener('progress', onProgressHandler); <a class="counter" id=
"download-co" href="#download"></a>
xhr.send();
</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="timeout" href="#timeout-co"></a>

            <p>Set request timeout to 5,000 ms (default: no timeout)

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="onload" href="#onload-co"></a>

      </div>

      <p>Either the <em>load</em> or <em>error</em> event will fire once to
      indicate the final status of the XHR transfer, whereas the
      <em>progress</em> event can fire any number of times and provides a
      convenient API for tracking transfer status: we can compare the
      <em>loaded</em> attribute against <em>total</em> to estimate the amount
      of transferred data.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-GBCeS2ie">
        <p>To estimate the amount of transferred data, the server must provide
        a content length in its response: we can’t estimate progress of chunked
        transfers, since by definition, the total size of the response is
        unknown.

        <p>Also, XHR requests do not have a default timeout, which means that a
        request can be "in progress" indefinitely. As a best practice, always
        set a meaningful timeout for your application and handle the error!

    <section>
      <h2 id="streaming-data-with-xhr"><a href="#streaming-data-with-xhr"
      class="anchor">§</a>Streaming Data with XHR</h2>

      <p>In some cases an application may need or want to process a stream of
      data incrementally: upload the data to the server as it becomes available
      on the client, or process the downloaded data as it arrives from the
      server. Unfortunately, while this is an important use case, today there
      is no simple, efficient, cross-browser API for XHR streaming:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The <em>send</em> method expects the full payload in case of
          uploads.

        <li>
          <p>The <em>response</em>, <em>responseText</em>, and
          <em>responseXML</em> attributes are not designed for streaming.
        </ul>

      <p>Streaming has never been an official use case within the official XHR
      specification. As a result, short of manually splitting an upload into
      smaller, individual XHRs, there is no API for streaming data from client
      to server. Similarly, while the XHR2 specification does provide some
      ability to read a partial response from the server, the implementation is
      inefficient and very limited. That’s the bad news.

      <p>The good news is that there is hope on the horizon! Lack of streaming
      support as a first-class use case for XHR is a well-recognized
      limitation, and there is work in progress to address the problem:

      <blockquote>
        <p>Web applications should have the ability to acquire and manipulate
        data in a wide variety of forms, including as a sequence of data made
        available over time. This specification defines the basic
        representation for Streams, errors raised by Streams, and programmatic
        ways to read and create Streams.

        <p data-type="attribution">W3C Streams API
      </blockquote>

      <p>The combination of XHR and Streams API will enable efficient XHR
      streaming in the browser. However, the Streams API is still under active
      discussion, and is not yet available in any browser. So, with that, we’re
      stuck, right? Well, not quite. As we noted earlier, streaming uploads
      with XHR is not an option, but we do have limited support for streaming
      downloads with XHR:

      <div data-type="example" id="-JjCxu8sn">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', '/stream');
xhr.seenBytes = 0;

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { <a class="counter" id="subscribe-co"
href="#subscribe"></a>
  if(xhr.readyState &gt; 2) {
    var newData = xhr.responseText.substr(xhr.seenBytes); <a class="counter"
id="strchunk-co" href="#strchunk"></a>
    // process newData

    xhr.seenBytes = xhr.responseText.length; <a class="counter" id="offset-co"
href="#offset"></a>
  }
};

xhr.send();
</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="subscribe" href="#subscribe-co"></a>

            <p>Subscribe to state and progress notifications

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="strchunk" href="#strchunk-co"></a>

            <p>Extract new data from partial response

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="offset" href="#offset-co"></a>

            <p>Update processed byte offset
          </ol>
      </div>

      <p>This example will work in most modern browsers. However, performance
      is not great, and there are a large number of implementation caveats and
      gotchas:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Note that we are manually tracking the offset for seen bytes and
          then manually slicing the data: <em>responseText</em> is buffering
          the full response! For small transfers, this may not be an issue, but
          for larger downloads, and especially on memory-constrained devices
          such as mobile handsets, this is a problem. The only way to release
          the buffered response is to finish the request and open a new one.

        <li>
          <p>Partial response can be read only from the <em>responseText</em>
          attribute, which limits us to text-only transfers. There is no way to
          read partial response of a binary transfer.

        <li>
          <p>Once partial data is read, we must identify message boundaries:
          application logic must define its own data format and then buffer and
          parse the stream to extract individual messages.

        <li>
          <p>Browsers differ in how they buffer received data: some browsers
          may release data immediately, while others may buffer small responses
          and release them in larger chunks.

        <li>
          <p>Browsers differ in which content-types they allow to be read
          incrementally—e.g., some allow "text/html," while others will only
          work with "application/x-javascript."
        </ul>

      <p>In short, currently, XHR streaming is neither efficient nor
      convenient, and to make matters worse, the lack of a common specification
      also means that the implementations differ from browser to browser. As a
      result, at least until the Streams API is available, XHR is not a good
      fit for streaming.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-dOCNURsR">
        <p>No need to despair! While XHR may not meet the criteria, we do have
        other transports that are optimized for the streaming use case:
        Server-Sent Events offers a convenient API for streaming text-based
        data from server to client, and WebSocket offers efficient,
        bidirectional streaming for both binary and text-based data.

        <p>Both Firefox and Internet Explorer provide custom "streaming XHR
        extensions":

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Firefox supports <code>moz-chunked-text</code> and

            <p>Internet Explorer supports <code>ms-stream</code>.
          </ul>

        <p>By setting the <code>responseType</code> attribute on the XHR object
        to one of the preceding types, both browsers will avoid buffering the
        full response and will also allow a binary response to be read
        incrementally from the XHR object. Unfortunately, there are no
        equivalent APIs in Chrome, Opera, or other popular browsers. As a
        result, XHR streaming is still an impractical transport for
        cross-browser applications.

      <h2 id="real-time-notifications-and-delivery"><a href=
      "#real-time-notifications-and-delivery" class="anchor">§</a>Real-Time
      Notifications and Delivery</h2>

      <p>XHR enables a simple and efficient way to synchronize client updates
      with the server: whenever necessary, an XHR request is dispatched by the
      client to update the appropriate data on the server. However, the same
      problem, but in reverse, is much harder. If data is updated on the
      server, how does the server notify the client?

      <p>HTTP does not provide any way for the server to initiate a new
      connection to the client. As a result, to receive real-time
      notifications, the client must either poll the server for updates or
      leverage a streaming transport to allow the server to push new
      notifications as they become available. Unfortunately, as we saw in the
      preceding section, support for XHR streaming is limited, which leaves us
      with XHR polling.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-2aCZtYHM">
        <p>"Real-time" has different meanings for different applications: some
        applications demand submillisecond overhead, while others may be just
        fine with delays measured in minutes. To determine the optimal
        transport, first define clear latency and overhead targets for your
        application!

      <section>
        <h3 id="polling-with-xhr"><a href="#polling-with-xhr" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Polling with XHR</h3>

        <p>One of the simplest strategies to retrieve updates from the server
        is to have the client do a periodic check: the client can initiate a
        background XHR request on a periodic interval (poll the server) to
        check for updates. If new data is available on the server, then it is
        returned in the response, and otherwise the response is empty.

        <p>Polling is simple to implement but frequently is also very
        inefficient. The choice of the polling interval is critical: long
        polling intervals translate to delayed delivery of updates, whereas
        short intervals result in unnecessary traffic and high overhead both
        for the client and the server. Let’s consider the simplest possible
        example:

        <div data-type="example" id="-DKCPt5FdHP">
          <pre data-type="programlisting">
function checkUpdates(url) {
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Each XHR request is a standalone HTTP request, and on average,
            HTTP incurs ~800 bytes of overhead (without HTTP cookies) for
            request/response headers.

          <li>
            <p>Periodic checks work well when data arrives at predictable
            intervals. Unfortunately, predictable arrival rates are an
            exception, not the norm. Consequently, periodic polling will
            introduce additional latency delays between the message being
            available on the server and its delivery to the client.

          <li>
            <p>Unless thought through carefully, polling often becomes a costly
            performance anti-pattern on wireless networks; see <a data-type=
            "xref" href=
            "/optimizing-for-mobile-networks/#eliminate-periodic-and-inefficient-data-transfers">
            Eliminate Periodic and Inefficient Data Transfers</a>. Waking up
            the radio consumes a lot of battery power!
          </ul>

        <p>What is the optimal polling interval? There isn’t one. The frequency
        depends on the requirements of the application, and there is an
        inherent trade-off between efficiency and message latency. As a result,
        polling is a good fit for applications where polling intervals are
        long, new events are arriving at a predictable rate, and the
        transferred payloads are large. This combination offsets the extra HTTP
        overhead and minimizes message delivery delays.

          "#modeling-performance-of-xhr-polling" class="anchor">§</a>Modeling
          Performance of XHR Polling</h4>

          <p>To illustrate the trade-off between latency and overhead of XHR
          polling, let’s consider a simple email application that is using XHR
          polling to check for message updates on the server. The
          implementation is as follows:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Every 60 seconds the client sends an XHR to check for updates.

            <li>
              <p>Each XHR request includes the most recent message ID known by
              the client.

            <li>
              <p>The server compares the client ID against its list of
              messages.

            <li>
              <p>The server responds with a list of new messages or an empty
              list (no updates).
            </ul>

          <dl>
            <dt>What is the average message latency delay?

            <dd>
              <p>If a new message arrives on the server just before the client
              checks for updates, then the delay is minimal—just the latency
              between client and server. Conversely, the same new message can
              arrive moments after the client check, in which case the message
              will have to wait until the next client check (60 seconds).
              Hence, if the message arrival rate is random, then an average
              message would wait for 30 seconds on the server before the client
              gets it.

            <dt>What is the overhead of polling?

            <dd>
              <p>An average HTTP 1.x request adds 800 bytes of request and
              response overhead (see <a data-type="xref" href=
              "/http1x/#measuring-and-controlling-protocol-overhead">Measuring
              and Controlling Protocol Overhead</a>). Because the client is
              logged in, we will also have an extra authentication cookie and
              the message ID; let’s say this adds another 50 bytes. Hence, a
              request that returns no new messages will incur 850 bytes! Now
              imagine we have 10,000 clients, all polling on a 60-second
              interval:

              <figure data-type="equation" id="id-kncdhltytwswf6h9">
                <img src=
                "/assets/equations/ff529f93b49270aac2bb7a2707a445e8.svg" class=
                "equation">
              </figure>

              <p>Each client sends 850 bytes of data on each request, which
              translates to 167 requests per second and a sustained rate of
              1.13 Mbps of ingress throughput on the server! And that’s a
              constant rate without actually delivering any new messages to any
              of the clients.
            </dl>

          <p>Is the 30-second delay too high? We can decrease the polling
          interval, but in doing so, we would incur higher throughput and
          overhead: the same 10,000 clients, but on a 1-second interval, would
          generate over 60 Mbps of throughput! In short, unless the polling
          intervals are long, polling is expensive.

        <p>The challenge with periodic polling is that there is potential for
        many unnecessary and empty checks. With that in mind, what if we made a
        slight modification (<a data-type="xref" href=
        "#polling-longpolling">Figure&nbsp;15-1</a>) to the polling workflow:
        instead of returning an empty response when no updates are available,
        could we keep the connection idle until an update is available?

        <figure id="polling-longpolling">

        <div data-type="note" id="id-x6CMtEhdHz">
          <p>The technique of leveraging a long-held HTTP request ("a hanging
          GET") to allow the server to push data to the browser is commonly
          known as "Comet." However, you may also encounter it under other
          names, such as "reverse AJAX," "AJAX push," and "HTTP push."
        </div>

        <p>By holding the connection open until an update is available
        (long-polling), data can be sent immediately to the client once it
        becomes available on the server. As a result, long-polling offers the
        best-case scenario for message latency, and it also eliminates empty
        checks, which reduces the number of XHR requests and the overall
        overhead of polling. Once an update is delivered, the long-poll request
        is finished and the client can issue another long-poll request and wait
        for the next available message:

        <div data-type="example" id="-dOCPhmhKH5">
          <pre data-type="programlisting">
function checkUpdates(url) {
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', url);
  xhr.onload = function() { <a class="counter" id="xhrlpollfn-co" href=
"#xhrlpollfn"></a>
    ...
    checkUpdates('/updates'); <a class="counter" id="xhrnext-co" href=
"#xhrnext"></a>
  };
  xhr.send();
}

checkUpdates('/updates'); <a class="counter" id="xhrlpoll-co" href=
"#xhrlpoll"></a>
</pre>

          <ol class="notation">
            <li>
              <a class="co" id="xhrlpollfn" href="#xhrlpollfn-co"></a>

              <p>Process received updates and open new long-poll XHR

            <li>
              <a class="co" id="xhrnext" href="#xhrnext-co"></a>

              <p>Issue long-poll request for next update (and loop forever)

            <li>
              <a class="co" id="xhrlpoll" href="#xhrlpoll-co"></a>

              <p>Issue initial long-poll XHR request
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>With that, is long-polling always a better choice than periodic
        polling? Unless the message arrival rate is known and constant,
        long-polling will always deliver better message latency. If that’s the
        primary criteria, then long-polling is the winner.

        <p>On the other hand, the overhead discussion requires a more nuanced
        view. First, note that each delivered message still incurs the same
        HTTP overhead; each new message is a standalone HTTP request. However,
        if the message arrival rate is high, then long-polling will issue more
        XHR requests than periodic polling!

        <p>Long-polling dynamically adapts to the message arrival rate by
        minimizing message latency, which is a behavior you may or may not
        want. If there is some tolerance for message latency, then polling may
        be a more efficient transport—e.g., if the update rate is high, then
        polling provides a simple "message aggregation" mechanism, which can
        reduce the number of requests and improve battery life on mobile
        handsets.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-ojCPC4hYHO">
          <p>In practice, not all messages have the same priority or latency
          requirements. As a result, you may want to consider a mix of
          strategies: aggregate low-priority updates on the server, and trigger
          immediate delivery for high priority updates; see <a data-type="xref"

          Chat via XHR Long-Polling</h4>

          <p>In practice, long-polling has become one of the most widely used
          methods for delivering real-time notifications via XHR. While it may
          not be the most efficient transport, it is simple, robust, and
          supported by any XHR-capable browser. Popular products such as
          Facebook’s Chat were first deployed in 2008 via this very method:

          <blockquote>
            <p>The method we chose to get text from one user to another
            involves loading an iframe on each Facebook page, and having that
            iframe’s JavaScript make an HTTP GET request over a persistent
            connection that doesn’t return until the server has data for the
            client. The request gets reestablished if it’s interrupted or times
            out. This isn’t by any means a new technique: it’s a variation of
            Comet, specifically XHR long-polling, and/or BOSH.

            <p data-type="attribution">Facebook Chat, <cite>Facebook
            Engineering Blog</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Today, we can deliver the same functionality much more efficiently
          via Server-Sent Events and WebSocket. Having said that, XHR is still
          a common fallback strategy for many real-time frameworks. If all else
          fails, long-polling to the rescue!

      <h2 id="xhr-use-cases-and-performance"><a href=
      "#xhr-use-cases-and-performance" class="anchor">§</a>XHR Use Cases and
      Performance</h2>

      <p>XMLHttpRequest is what enabled us to make the leap from building pages
      to building interactive web applications in the browser. First, it
      enabled asynchronous communication within the browser, but just as
      importantly, it also made the process simple. Dispatching and controlling
      a scripted HTTP request takes just a few lines of JavaScript code, and
      the browser handles all the rest:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Browser formats the HTTP request and parses the response.

        <li>
          <p>Browser enforces relevant security (same-origin) policies.

        <li>
          <p>Browser handles content negotiation (e.g., gzip).

        <li>
          <p>Browser handles request and response caching.

        <li>
          <p>Browser handles authentication, redirects, and more…
        </ul>

      <p>As such, XHR is a versatile and a high-performance transport for any
      transfers that follow the HTTP request-response cycle. Need to fetch a
      resource that requires authentication, should be compressed while in
      transfer, and should be cached for future lookups? The browser takes care
      of all of this and more, allowing us to focus on the application logic!

      <p>However, XHR also has its limitations. As we saw, streaming has never
      been an official use case in the XHR standard, and the support is
      limited: streaming with XHR is neither efficient nor convenient.
      Different browsers have different behaviors, and efficient binary
      streaming is impossible. In short, XHR is not a good fit for streaming.

      <p>Similarly, there is no one best strategy for delivering real-time
      updates with XHR. Periodic polling incurs high overhead and message
      latency delays. Long-polling delivers low latency but still has the same
      per-message overhead; each message is its own HTTP request. To have both
      low latency and low overhead, we need XHR streaming!

      <p>As a result, while XHR is a popular mechanism for "real-time"
      delivery, it may not be the best-performing transport for the job. Modern
      browsers support both simpler and more efficient options, such as
      Server-Sent Events and WebSocket. Hence, unless you have a specific
      reason why XHR polling is required, use them.
