      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>In any complex system, a large part of the performance optimization
      process is the untangling of the interactions between the many distinct
      and separate layers of the system, each with its own set of constraints
      and limitations. So far, we have examined a number of individual
      networking components in close detail—different physical delivery methods
      and transport protocols—and now we can turn our attention to the larger,
      end-to-end picture of web performance optimization:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Impact of latency and bandwidth on web performance

        <li>
          <p>Transport protocol (TCP) constraints imposed on HTTP

        <li>
          <p>Features and shortcomings of the HTTP protocol itself

        <li>
          <p>Web application trends and performance requirements

        <li>
          <p>Browser constraints and optimizations
        </ul>

      <p>Optimizing the interaction among all the different layers is not
      unlike solving a family of equations, each dependent on the others, but
      nonetheless yielding many possible solutions. There is no one fixed set
      of recommendations or best practices, and the individual components
      continue to evolve: browsers are getting faster, user connectivity
      profiles change, and web applications continue to grow in their scope,
      ambition, and complexity.

      <p>Hence, before we dive into enumerating and analyzing individual
      performance best practices, it is important to step back and define what
      the problem really is: what a modern web application is, what tools we
      have at our disposal, how we measure web-performance, and which parts of
      the system are helping and hindering our progress.

      <h2 id="hypertext-web-pages-and-web-applications"><a href=
      "#hypertext-web-pages-and-web-applications" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Hypertext, Web Pages, and Web Applications</h2>

      <p>The evolution of the Web over the course of the last few decades has
      given us at least three different classes of experience: the hypertext
      document, rich media web page, and interactive web application.
      Admittedly, the line between the latter two may at times be blurry to the
      user, but from a performance point of view, each requires a very
      different approach to our conversation, metrics, and the definition of
      performance.

      <dl>
        <dt>Hypertext document

        <dd>
          <p>Hypertext documents were the genesis of the World Wide Web, the
          plain text version with some basic formatting and support for
          hyperlinks. This may not sound exciting by modern standards, but it
          proved the premise, vision, and the great utility of the World Wide
          Web.

        <dt>Web page

        <dd>
          <p>The HTML working group and the early browser vendors extended the
          definition of hypertext to support additional hypermedia resources,
          such as images and audio, and added many other primitives for richer
          layouts. The era of the <em>web page</em> has arrived, allowing us to
          produce rich visual layouts with various media types: visually
          beautiful but mostly non-interactive, not unlike a printed page.

        <dt>Web application

        <dd>
          <p>Addition of JavaScript and later revolutions of Dynamic HTML
          (DHTML) and AJAX shook things up once more and transformed the simple
          web page into an interactive <em>web application</em>, which allowed
          it to respond to the user directly within the browser. This paved the
          way for the first full-fledged browser applications, such as Outlook
          Web Access (originator of XMLHTTP support in IE5), ushering in a new
          era of complex dependency graphs of scripts, stylesheets, and markup.
        </dl>

      <p>An HTTP 0.9 session consisted of a single document request, which was
      perfectly sufficient for delivery of hypertext: single document, one TCP
      connection, followed by connection close. Consequently, tuning for
      performance was as simple as optimizing for a single HTTP request over a
      short-lived TCP connection.

      <p>The advent of the <em>web page</em> changed the formula from delivery
      of a single document to the document plus its dependent resources.
      Consequently, HTTP/1.0 introduced the notion of HTTP metadata (headers),
      and HTTP/1.1 enhanced it with a variety of performance-oriented
      primitives, such as well-defined caching, keepalive, and more. Hence,
      multiple TCP connections are now potentially at play, and the key
      performance metric has shifted from <em>document load time</em> to
      <em>page load time</em>, which is commonly abbreviated as PLT.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-zbupf8fK">
        <p>The simplest definition of PLT is "the time until the loading
        spinner stops spinning in the browser." A more technical definition is
        time to onload event in the browser, which is an event fired by the
        browser once the document and all of its dependent resources
        (JavaScript, images, etc.) have finished loading.
      </div>

      <p>Finally, the web application transformed the simple web page, which
      used media as an enhancement to the primary content in the markup, into a
      complex dependency graph: markup defines the basic structure, stylesheets
      define the layout, and scripts build up the resulting interactive
      application and respond to user input, potentially modifying both styles
      and markup in the process.

      <p>Consequently, page load time, which has been the de facto metric of
      the web performance world, is also an increasingly insufficient
      performance benchmark: we are no longer building pages, we are building
      dynamic and interactive web applications. Instead of, or in addition to,
      measuring the time to load each and every resource (PLT), we are now
      interested in answering application-specific questions:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>What are the milestones in the loading progress of the
          application?

        <li>
          <p>What are the times to first interaction by the user?

        <li>
          <p>What are the interactions the user should engage in?

        <li>
          <p>What are the engagement and conversion rates for each user?
        </ul>

      <p>The success of your performance and optimization strategy is directly
      correlated to your ability to define and iterate on application-specific
      benchmarks and criteria. Nothing beats application-specific knowledge and
      measurements, especially when linked to bottom-line goals and metrics of
      your business.

      <aside>
        <h4 id="dom-cssom-and-javascript"><a href="#dom-cssom-and-javascript"
        class="anchor">§</a>DOM, CSSOM, and JavaScript</h4>

        <p>What exactly do we mean by "complex dependency graph of scripts,
        stylesheets, and markup" found in a modern web application? To answer
        this question, we need to take a quick detour into browser architecture
        and investigate how the parsing, layout, and scripting pipelines have
        to come together to paint the pixels to the screen.

        <figure id="doc-render-js">
          <img src="/assets/diagrams/084666d979c7b1507df8c538f5557ac9.svg" alt=
          "Figure 10-1. Browser processing pipeline: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript">

          <figcaption>
            <span class="label">Figure 10-1.</span> Browser processing
            pipeline: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The parsing of the HTML document is what constructs the Document
        Object Model (DOM). In parallel, there is an oft-forgotten cousin, the
        CSS Object Model (CSSOM), which is constructed from the specified
        stylesheet rules and resources. The two are then combined to create the
        "render tree," at which point the browser has enough information to
        perform a layout and paint something to the screen. So far, so good.

        <p>However, this is where we must, unfortunately, introduce our
        favorite friend and foe: JavaScript. Script execution can issue a
        synchronous <code>doc.write</code> and block DOM parsing and
        construction. Similarly, scripts can query for a computed style of any
        object, which means that JavaScript can also block on CSS.
        Consequently, the construction of DOM and CSSOM objects is frequently
        intertwined: DOM construction cannot proceed until JavaScript is
        executed, and JavaScript execution cannot proceed until CSSOM is
        available.

        <p>The performance of your application, especially the first load and
        the "time to render" depends directly on how this dependency graph
        between markup, stylesheets, and JavaScript is resolved. Incidentally,
        recall the popular "styles at the top, scripts at the bottom" best
        practice? Now you know why! Rendering and script execution are blocked
        on stylesheets; get the CSS down to the user as quickly as you can.

      <h2 id="anatomy-of-a-modern-web-application"><a href=
      "#anatomy-of-a-modern-web-application" class="anchor">§</a>Anatomy of a
      Modern Web Application</h2>

      <p>What does a modern web application look like after all? <a href=
      "http://httparchive.org/">HTTP Archive</a> can help us answer this
      question. The project tracks how the Web is built by periodically
      crawling the most popular sites (300,000+ from Alexa Top 1M) and
      recording and aggregating analytics on the number of used resources,
      content types, headers, and other metadata for each individual
      destination.

      <p>An average web application, as of early 2013, is composed of the
      following:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>90 requests, fetched from 15 hosts, with 1,311 KB total transfer
          size

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>HTML: 10 requests, 52 KB

            <li>
              <p>Images: 55 requests, 812 KB

            <li>
              <p>JavaScript: 15 requests, 216 KB

            <li>
              <p>CSS: 5 requests, 36 KB

            <li>
              <p>Other: 5 requests, 195 KB
            </ul>
        </ul>

      <p>By the time you read this, the preceding numbers have already changed
      and have grown even larger (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-archive">Figure&nbsp;10-2</a>); the upward climb has been a stable
      and reliable trend with no signs of stopping. However, exact request and
      kilobyte count aside, it is the order of magnitude of these individual
      components that warrants some careful contemplation: an average web
      application is now well over 1 MB in size and is composed of roughly 100
      sub-resources delivered from over 15 different hosts!

      <figure id="http-archive">
        <img src="/assets/diagrams/0b2435f40a21288f26b55208d5a8c5b1.svg" alt=

      </figure>

      <p>Unlike their desktop counterparts, web applications do not require a
      separate installation process: type in the URL, hit Enter, and we are up
      and running! However, desktop applications pay the installation cost just
      once, whereas web applications are running the "installation process" on
      each and every visit—resource downloads, DOM and CSSOM construction, and
      JavaScript execution. No wonder web performance is such a fast-growing
      field and a hot topic of discussion! Hundreds of resources, megabytes of
      data, dozens of different hosts, all of which must come together in
      hundreds of milliseconds to facilitate the desired instant web
      experience.

        "#speed-performance-and-human-perception" class="anchor">§</a>Speed,
        Performance, and Human Perception</h3>

        <p>Speed and performance are relative terms. Each application dictates
        its own set of requirements based on business criteria, context, user
        expectations, and the complexity of the task that must be performed.
        Having said that, if the application must react and respond to a user,
        then we must plan and design for specific, <em>user-centric perceptual
        processing time constants</em>. Despite the ever-accelerating pace of
        life, or at least the feeling of it, our reaction times remain constant
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#perception">Table&nbsp;10-1</a>),
        regardless of type of application (online or offline), or medium
        (laptop, desktop, or mobile device).

        <div data-type="note" id="id-WpuDCet1TJ">
          <p>The preceding table helps explain the unofficial rule of thumb in
          the web performance community: render pages, or at the very least
          provide visual feedback, in under 250 milliseconds to keep the user
          engaged!
        </div>

        <p>For an application to feel instant, a perceptible response to user
        input must be provided within hundreds of milliseconds. After a second
        or more, the user’s flow and engagement with the initiated task is
        broken, and after 10 seconds have passed, unless progress feedback is
        provided, the task is frequently abandoned.

        <p>Now, add up the network latency of a DNS lookup, followed by a TCP
        handshake, and another few roundtrips for a typical web page request,
        and much, if not all, of our 100–1,000 millisecond latency budget can
        be easily spent on just the networking overhead; see <a data-type=
        "xref" href=
        "/optimizing-for-mobile-networks/#http-latency-components">Figure&nbsp;8-2</a>.
        No wonder so many users, especially when on a mobile or a wireless
        network, are demanding faster web browsing performance!

        <div data-type="note" id="id-xzuvTLt5Tq">
          <p>Jakob Nielsen’s <em>Usability Engineering</em> and Steven Seow’s
          <em>Designing and Engineering Time</em> are both excellent resources
          that every developer and designer should read! Time is measured
          objectively but perceived subjectively, and <em>experiences can be
          engineered</em> to improve perceived performance.

          "anchor">§</a>Translating Web Performance to Dollars and Cents</h4>

          <p>Speed is a feature, and it is not simply speed for speed’s sake.
          Well-publicized studies from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all show
          that web performance translates directly to dollars and cents—e.g., a
          2,000 ms delay on Bing search pages decreased per-user revenue by
          4.3%!

          <p>Similarly, an Aberdeen study of over 160 organizations determined
          that an extra <em>one-second</em> delay in page load times led to 7%
          loss in conversions, 11% fewer page views, and a 16% decrease in
          customer satisfaction!

          <p>Faster sites yield more page views, higher engagement, and higher
          conversion rates. However, don’t just take our word for it, or put
          your faith into well-cited industry benchmarks: measure the impact of
          web performance on your own site, and against your own conversion
          metrics. If you’re wondering how, then keep reading, or skip ahead to

        <p>No discussion on web performance is complete without a mention of
        the resource waterfall. In fact, the resource waterfall is likely the
        single most insightful network performance and diagnostics tool at our

          <p>WebPageTest.org is an open-source project and a free web service
          that provides a system for testing the performance of web pages from
          multiple locations around the world: the browser runs within a
          virtual machine and can be configured and scripted with a variety of
          connection and browser-oriented settings. Following the test, the
          results are then available through a web interface, which makes
          WebPageTest an indispensable power tool in your web performance

        <p>To start, it is important to recognize that every HTTP request is
        composed of a number of separate stages (<a data-type="xref" href=
        "#request-components">Figure&nbsp;10-3</a>): DNS resolution, TCP
        connection handshake, TLS negotiation (if required), dispatch of the
        HTTP request, followed by content download. The visual display of these
        individual stages may differ slightly within each browser, but to keep
        things simple, we will use the WebPageTest version in this chapter.
        Make sure to familiarize yourself with the meaning of each color in
        your favorite browser.

        <p>Close analysis of <a data-type="xref" href=
        "#request-components">Figure&nbsp;10-3</a> shows that the Yahoo!
        homepage took 683 ms to download, and over 200 ms of that time was
        spent waiting on the network, which amounts to 30% of total latency of
        the request! However, the document request is only the beginning since,
        as we know, a modern web application also needs a wide variety of
        resources (<a data-type="xref" href=
        "#yahoo-waterfall">Figure&nbsp;10-4</a>) to produce the final output.
        To be exact, to load the Yahoo! homepage, the browser will require 52
        resources, fetched from 30 different hosts, all adding up to 486 KB in
        total.

        <p>The resource waterfall reveals a number of important insights about
        the structure of the page and the browser processing pipeline. First
        off, notice that while the content of the <em>www.yahoo.com</em>
        document is being fetched, new HTTP requests are being dispatched: HTML
        parsing is performed incrementally, allowing the browser to discover
        required resources early and dispatch the necessary requests in
        parallel. Hence, the scheduling of when the resource is fetched is in
        large part determined by the structure of the markup. The browser may
        reprioritize some requests, but the incremental discovery of each
        resource in the document is what creates the distinct resource
        "waterfall effect."

        <p>Second, notice that the "Start Render" (green vertical line) occurs
        well before all the resources are fully loaded, allowing the user to
        begin interacting with the page while the page is being built. In fact,
        the "Document Complete" event (blue vertical line), also fires early
        and well before the remaining assets are loaded. In other words, the
        browser spinner has stopped spinning, the user is able to continue with
        his task, but the Yahoo! homepage is progressively filling in
        additional content, such as advertising and social widgets, in the
        background.

            waterfall (WebPageTest, March 2013)
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The difference between the first render time, document complete, and
        the time to finish fetching the last resource in the preceding example
        is a great illustration of the necessary context when discussing
        different web performance metrics. Which of those three metrics is the
        right one to track? There is no one single answer; each application is
        different! Yahoo! engineers have chosen to optimize the page to take
        advantage of incremental loading to allow the user to begin consuming
        the important content earlier, and in doing so they had to apply
        application-specific knowledge about which content is critical and
        which can be filled in later.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-DZuAHZcvTX">
          <p>Different browsers implement different logic for when, and in
          which order, the individual resource requests are dispatched. As a
          result, the performance of the application will vary from browser to
          browser.

          <p>Tip: WebPageTest allows you to select both the location and the
          make and version of the browser when running the test!
        </div>

        <p>The network waterfall is a power tool that can help reveal the
        chosen optimizations, or lack thereof, for any page or application. The
        previous process of analyzing and optimizing the resource waterfall is
        often referred to as <em>front-end performance</em> analysis and
        optimization. However, the name may be an unfortunate choice, as it
        misleads many to believe that all performance bottlenecks are now on
        the client. In reality, while JavaScript, CSS, and rendering pipelines
        are critical and resource-intensive steps, the server response times
        and network latency ("back-end performance") are no less critical for
        optimizing the resource waterfall. After all, you can’t parse or
        execute a resource that is blocked on the network!

        <p>To illustrate this in action, we only have to switch from the
        <em>resource waterfall</em> to the <em>connection view</em>
        (<a data-type="xref" href=
        "#yahoo-connection-view">Figure&nbsp;10-5</a>) provided by WebPageTest.

        <p>Unlike the resource waterfall, where each record represents an
        individual HTTP request, the connection view shows the life of each TCP
        connection—all 30 of them in this case—used to fetch the resources for
        the Yahoo! homepage. Does anything stand out? Notice that the download
        time, indicated in blue, is but a small fraction of the total latency
        of each connection: there are 15 DNS lookups, 30 TCP handshakes, and a
        lot of network latency (indicated in green) while waiting to receive
        the first byte of each response.

        <figure id="yahoo-connection-view">

        <div data-type="note" id="id-3JubsVcDTZ">
          <p>Wondering why some requests are showing the green bar (time to
          first byte) only? Many responses are very small, and consequently the
          download time does not register on the diagram. In fact, for many
          requests, response times are often dominated by the roundtrip latency
          and server processing times.
        </div>

        <p>Finally, we have saved the best for last. The <em>real</em> surprise
        to many is found at the bottom of the connection view: examine the
        bandwidth utilization chart in <a data-type="xref" href=
        "#yahoo-connection-view">Figure&nbsp;10-5</a>. With the exception of a
        few short data bursts, the utilization of the available connection is
        very low—it appears that we are not limited by bandwidth of our
        connection! Is this an anomaly, or worse, a browser bug? Unfortunately,
        it is neither. Turns out, bandwidth is not the limiting performance
        factor for most web applications. Instead, the bottleneck is the
        network roundtrip latency between the client and the server.

      "#performance-pillars-computing-rendering-networking" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Performance Pillars: Computing, Rendering, Networking</h2>

      <p>The execution of a web program primarily involves three tasks:
      fetching resources, page layout and rendering, and JavaScript execution.
      The rendering and scripting steps follow a single-threaded, interleaved
      model of execution; it is not possible to perform concurrent
      modifications of the resulting Document Object Model (DOM). Hence,
      optimizing how the rendering and script execution runtimes work together,
      as we saw in <a data-type="xref" href="#dom-cssom-and-javascript">DOM,
      CSSOM, and JavaScript</a>, is of critical importance.

      <p>However, optimizing JavaScript execution and rendering pipelines also
      won’t do much good if the browser is blocked on the network, waiting for
      the resources to arrive. Fast and efficient delivery of network resources
      is the performance keystone of each and every application running in the
      browser.

      <p>But, one might ask, Internet speeds are getting faster by the day, so
      won’t this problem solve itself? Yes, our applications are growing
      larger, but if the global average speed is already at 3.1 Mbps
      (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#bandwidth-at-the-network-edge">Bandwidth
      at the Network Edge</a>) and growing, as evidenced by ubiquitous
      advertising by every ISP and mobile carrier, why bother, right?
      Unfortunately, as you might intuit, and as the Yahoo! example shows, if
      that were the case then you wouldn’t be reading this book. Let’s take a
      closer look.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-A3u5F3tb">
        <p>For a detailed discussion of the trends and interplay of bandwidth
        and latency, refer back to the "Primer on Latency and Bandwidth" in
        <a data-type="xref" href="/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/">Primer on

        "#more-bandwidth-doesnt-matter-much" class="anchor">§</a>More Bandwidth
        Doesn’t Matter (Much)</h3>

        <p>Hold your horses; of course bandwidth matters! After all, every
        commercial by our local ISP and mobile carrier continues to remind us
        of its many benefits: faster downloads, uploads, and streaming, all at
        up to speeds of <em>[insert latest number here]</em> Mbps!

        <p>Access to higher bandwidth data rates is always good, especially for
        cases that involve bulk data transfers: video and audio streaming or
        any other type of large data transfer. However, when it comes to
        everyday web browsing, which requires fetching hundreds of relatively
        small resources from dozens of different hosts, roundtrip latency is
        the limiting factor:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Streaming an HD video from the Yahoo! homepage is bandwidth
            limited.

          <li>
            <p>Loading and rendering the Yahoo! homepage is latency limited.
          </ul>

        <p>Depending on the quality and the encoding of the video you are
        trying to stream, you may need anywhere from a few hundred Kbps to
        several Mbps in bandwidth capacity—e.g., 3+ Mbps for an HD 1080p video
        stream. This data rate is now within reach for many users, which is
        evidenced by the growing popularity of streaming video services such as
        Netflix. Why, then, would downloading a much, much smaller web
        application be such a challenge for a connection capable of streaming
        an HD movie?

        <p>We have already covered all the necessary topics in preceding
        chapters to make a good qualitative theory as to why latency may be the
        limiting factor for everyday web browsing. However, a picture is worth
        a thousand words, so let’s examine the results of a quantitative study
        performed by Mike Belshe (<a data-type="xref" href=
        "#bandwidth-vs-latency">Figure&nbsp;10-6</a>), one of the creators of
        the SPDY protocol, on the impact of varying bandwidth vs. latency on
        the page load times of some of the most popular destinations on the
        Web.

        <figure id="bandwidth-vs-latency">
          <img src="/assets/diagrams/940cb8cfbb433a04b05e15b4868cb8e3.svg" alt=

            bandwidth and latency
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <div data-type="note" id="id-WpuDCRTntJ">
          <p>This study by Mike Belshe served as a launching point for the
          development of the SPDY protocol at Google, which later became the
          foundation of the HTTP/2 protocol.
        </div>

        <p>In the first test, the connection latency is held fixed, and the
        connection bandwidth is incrementally increased from 1 Mbps up to 10
        Mbps. Notice that at first, upgrading the connection from 1 to 2 Mbps
        nearly halves the page loading time—exactly the result we want to see.
        However, following that, each incremental improvement in bandwidth
        yields diminishing returns. By the time the available bandwidth exceeds
        5 Mbps, we are looking at single-digit percent improvements, and
        upgrading from 5 Mbps to 10 Mbps results in a mere 5% improvement in
        page loading times!

        <p>Akamai’s broadband speed report (<a data-type="xref" href=
        "/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#bandwidth-at-the-network-edge">Bandwidth
        at the Network Edge</a>) shows that an average consumer in the United
        States is already accessing the Web with 5 Mbps+ of available
        bandwidth—a number that many other countries are quickly approaching or
        have surpassed already. Ergo, we are led to conclude that an average
        consumer in the United States would not benefit <em>much</em> from
        upgrading the available bandwidth of her connection if she is
        interested in improving her web browsing speeds. She may be able to
        stream or upload larger media files more quickly, but the pages
        containing those files will not load noticeably faster: <em>bandwidth
        doesn’t matter, much</em>.

        <p>However, the latency experiment tells an entirely different story:
        for every 20 millisecond improvement in latency, we have a linear
        improvement in page loading times! Perhaps it is latency we should be
        optimizing for when deciding on an ISP, and not just bandwidth?

        <blockquote>
          <p>To speed up the Internet at large, we should look for more ways to
          bring down RTT. What if we could reduce cross-atlantic RTTs from 150
          ms to 100 ms? This would have a larger effect on the speed of the
          internet than increasing a user’s bandwidth from 3.9 Mbps to 10 Mbps
          or even 1 Gbps.

          <p>Another approach to reducing page load times would be to reduce
          the number of round trips required per page load. Today, web pages
          require a certain amount of back and forth between the client and
          server. The number of round trips is largely due to the handshakes to
          start communicating between client and server (e.g., DNS, TCP, HTTP),
          and also round trips induced by the communication protocols (e.g.,
          TCP slow start). If we can improve protocols to transfer this data
          with fewer round trips, we should also be able to improve page load
          times. This is one of the goals of SPDY.

          <p data-type="attribution">Mike Belshe, <cite>More Bandwidth Doesn't
          Matter (Much)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The previous results are a surprise to many, but they really should
        not be, as they are a direct consequence of the performance
        characteristics of the underlying protocols: TCP handshakes, flow and
        congestion control, and head-of-line blocking due to packet loss. Most
        of the HTTP data flows consist of small, bursty data transfers, whereas
        TCP is optimized for long-lived connections and bulk data transfers.
        Network roundtrip time is the limiting factor in TCP throughput and
        performance in most cases; see <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/building-blocks-of-tcp/#optimizing-for-tcp">Optimizing for TCP</a>.
        Consequently, latency is also the performance bottleneck for HTTP and
        most web applications delivered over it.

        <div data-type="note" id="id-EGupuqTwtO">
          <p>If latency is the limiting performance factor for most wired
          connections then, as you might intuit, it is an even more important
          performance bottleneck for wireless clients: wireless latencies are
          significantly higher, making networking optimization a critical
          priority for the mobile web.

      <h2 id="synthetic-and-real-user-performance-measurement"><a href=
      "#synthetic-and-real-user-performance-measurement" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Synthetic and Real-User Performance Measurement</h2>

      <p>If we can measure it, we can improve it. The question is, are we
      measuring the right criteria, and is the process sound? As we noted
      earlier, measuring the performance of a modern web application is a
      nontrivial challenge: there is no one single metric that holds true for
      every application, which means that we must carefully define custom
      metrics in each case. Then, once the criteria are established, we must
      gather the performance data, which should be done through a combination
      of synthetic and real-user performance measurement.

      <p>Broadly speaking, synthetic testing refers to any process with a
      controlled measurement environment: a local build process running through
      a performance suite, load testing against staging infrastructure, or a
      set of geo-distributed monitoring servers that periodically perform a set
      of scripted actions and log the outcomes. Each and every one of these
      tests may test a different piece of the infrastructure (e.g., application
      server throughput, database performance, DNS timing, and so on), and
      serves as a stable baseline to help detect regressions or narrow in on a
      specific component of the system.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-A3uXC2cb">
        <p>When configured well, synthetic testing provides a controlled and
        reproducible performance testing environment, which makes it a great
        fit for identifying and fixing performance regressions before they
        reach the user. Tip: identify your key performance metrics and set a
        "budget" for each one as part of your synthetic testing. If the budget
        is exceeded, raise an alarm!
      </div>

      <p>However, synthetic testing is not sufficient to identify all
      performance bottlenecks. Specifically, the problem is that the gathered
      measurements are not representative of the wide diversity of the
      real-world factors that will determine the final user experience with the
      application. Some contributing factors to this gap include the following:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Scenario and page selection: replicating real user navigation
          patterns is hard.

        <li>
          <p>Browser cache: performance may vary widely based on the state of
          the user’s cache.

        <li>
          <p>Intermediaries: performance may vary based on intermediate proxies
          and caches.

        <li>
          <p>Diversity of hardware: wide range of CPU, GPU, and memory
          performance.

        <li>
          <p>Diversity of browsers: wide range of browser versions, both old
          and new.

        <li>
          <p>Connectivity: continuously changing bandwidth and latency of real
          connections.
        </ul>

      <p>The combination of these and similar factors means that in addition to
      synthetic testing, we must augment our performance strategy with
      real-user measurement (RUM) to capture actual performance of our
      application as experienced by the user. The good news is the W3C Web
      Performance Working Group has made this part of our data-gathering
      process a simple one by introducing the Navigation Timing API
      (<a data-type="xref" href="#navigation-timing">Figure&nbsp;10-7</a>),
      which is now supported across many of the modern desktop and mobile
      browsers.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-WpuxcwcD">
        <p>As of early 2013, Navigation Timing is supported by IE9+, Chrome 6+,
        and Firefox 7+ across desktop and mobile platforms. The notable

        <a href="http://caniuse.com/nav-timing">caniuse.com/nav-timing</a>.
      </div>

      <p>The real benefit of Navigation Timing is that it exposes a lot of
      previously inaccessible data, such as DNS and TCP connect times, with
      high precision (microsecond timestamps), via a standardized
      <code>performance.timing</code> object in each browser. Hence, the data
      gathering process is very simple: load the page, grab the timing object
      from the user’s browser, and beacon it back to your analytics servers! By
      capturing this data, we can observe real-world performance of our
      applications as seen by real users, on real hardware, and across a wide
      variety of different networks.

        metrics when analyzing skewed and multimodal distributions.
        <a data-type="xref" href="#igvita-timing">Figure&nbsp;10-8</a> shows a
        hands-on, real-world example of both types of distributions on a single
        site: skewed distribution for the page load time and a multimodal
        distribution for the server response time (the two modes are due to
        cached vs. uncached page generation time by the application server).

        <p>Ensure that your analytics tool can provide the right statistical
        metrics for your performance data. The preceding data was taken from
        Google Analytics, which provides a histogram view within the standard
        Site Speed reports. Google Analytics automatically gathers Navigation
        Timing data when the analytics tracker is installed. Similarly, there
        are a wide variety of other analytics vendors who offer Navigation
        Timing data gathering and reporting.
      </aside>

      <p>Finally, in addition to Navigation Timing, the W3C Performance Group
      also standardized two other APIs: User Timing and Resource Timing.
      Whereas Navigation Timing provides performance timers for root documents
      only, Resource Timing provides similar performance data for each resource
      on the page, allowing us to gather the full performance profile of the
      page. Similarly, User Timing provides a simple JavaScript API to mark and
      measure application-specific performance metrics with the help of the
      same high-resolution timers:

      <div data-type="example" id="-qLuOS0cp">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">
function init() {
  performance.mark("startTask1"); <a class="counter" id="mark-co" href=
"#mark"></a>
  applicationCode1(); <a class="counter" id="app-co" href="#app"></a>
  performance.mark("endTask1");

  logPerformance();
}

function logPerformance() {
  var perfEntries = performance.getEntriesByType("mark");
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; perfEntries.length; i++) { <a class="counter" id=
"perf-co" href="#perf"></a>
    console.log("Name: " + perfEntries[i].name +
                " Entry Type: " + perfEntries[i].entryType +
                " Start Time: " + perfEntries[i].startTime +
                " Duration: "   + perfEntries[i].duration  + "\n");
  }
  console.log(performance.timing); <a class="counter" id="navtiming-co" href=
"#navtiming"></a>
}
</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="mark" href="#mark-co"></a>

            <p>Store (mark) timestamp with associated name (startTask1).

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="app" href="#app-co"></a>

            <p>Execute application code.

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="perf" href="#perf-co"></a>

            <p>Iterate and log user timing data.

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="navtiming" href="#navtiming-co"></a>

            <p>Log Navigation Timing object for current page.
          </ol>
      </div>

      <p>The combination of Navigation, Resource, and User timing APIs provides
      all the necessary tools to instrument and conduct real-user performance
      measurement for every web application; there is no longer any excuse not
      to do it right. We optimize what we measure, and RUM and synthetic
      testing are complementary approaches to help you identify regressions and
      real-world bottlenecks in the performance and the user experience of your
      applications.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-EGu3ILcy">
        <p>Custom and application-specific metrics are the key to establishing
        a sound performance strategy. There is no generic way to measure or
        define the quality of user experience. Instead, we must define and
        instrument specific milestones and events in each application, a
        process that requires collaboration between all the stakeholders in the
        project: business owners, designers, and developers.

      <h2 id="browser-optimization"><a href="#browser-optimization" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Browser Optimization</h2>

      <p>We would be remiss if we didn’t mention that a modern browser is much
      more than a simple network socket manager. Performance is one of the
      primary competitive features for each browser vendor, and given that the
      networking performance is such a critical criteria, it should not
      surprise you that the browsers are getting smarter every day:
      pre-resolving likely DNS lookups, pre-connecting to likely destinations,
      pre-fetching and prioritizing critical resources on the page, and more.

      <p>The exact list of performed optimizations will differ by browser
      vendor, but at their core the optimizations can be grouped into two broad
      classes:

      <dl>
        <dt>Document-aware optimization

        <dd>
          <p>The networking stack is integrated with the document, CSS, and
          JavaScript parsing pipelines to help identify and prioritize critical
          network assets, dispatch them early, and get the page to an
          interactive state as soon as possible. This is often done via
          resource priority assignments, lookahead parsing, and similar
          techniques.

        <dt>Speculative optimization

        <dd>
          <p>The browser may learn user navigation patterns over time and
          perform speculative optimizations in an attempt to predict the likely
          user actions by pre-resolving DNS names, pre-connecting to likely
          hostnames, and so on.
        </dl>

      <p>The good news is all of these optimizations are done automatically on
      our behalf and often lead to hundreds of milliseconds of saved network
      latency. Having said that, it is important to understand how and why
      these optimizations work under the hood, because we <em>can</em> assist
      the browser and help it do an even better job at accelerating our
      applications. There are four techniques employed by most browsers:

      <dl>
        <dt>Resource pre-fetching and prioritization

        <dd>
          <p>Document, CSS, and JavaScript parsers may communicate extra
          information to the network stack to indicate the relative priority of
          each resource: blocking resources required for first rendering are
          given high priority, while low-priority requests may be temporarily
          held back in a queue.

        <dt>DNS pre-resolve

        <dd>
          <p>Likely hostnames are pre-resolved ahead of time to avoid DNS
          latency on a future HTTP request. A pre-resolve may be triggered
          through learned navigation history, a user action such as hovering
          over a link, or other signals on the page.

        <dt>TCP pre-connect

        <dd>
          <p>Following a DNS resolution, the browser may speculatively open the
          TCP connection in an anticipation of an HTTP request. If it guesses
          right, it can eliminate another full roundtrip (TCP handshake) of
          network latency.

        <dt>Page pre-rendering

        <dd>
          <p>Some browsers allow you to hint the likely next destination and
          can pre-render the entire page in a hidden tab, such that it can be
          instantly swapped in when the user initiates the navigation.
        </dl>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-J9uVTBua">
        <p>For a deep dive into how these and other networking optimizations
        are implemented in Google Chrome, see <a href=
        "https://hpbn.co/chrome-networking">High Performance Networking in
        Google Chrome</a>.
      </div>

      <p>From the outside, a modern browser network stack presents itself as
      simple resource-fetching mechanism, but from the inside, it is an
      elaborate and a fascinating case study for how to optimize for web
      performance. So how can we assist the browser in this quest? To start,
      pay close attention to the structure and the delivery of each page:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Critical resources such as CSS and JavaScript should be
          discoverable as early as possible in the document.

        <li>
          <p>CSS should be delivered as early as possible to unblock rendering
          and JavaScript execution.

        <li>
          <p>Noncritical JavaScript should be deferred to avoid blocking DOM
          and CSSOM construction.

        <li>
          <p>The HTML document is parsed incrementally by the parser; hence the
          document should be periodically flushed for best performance.
        </ul>

      <p>Further, aside from optimizing the structure of the page, we can also
      embed additional hints into the document itself to tip off the browser
      about additional optimizations it can perform on our behalf:

      <div data-type="example" id="-xzuoHPuV">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">
&lt;link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//hostname_to_resolve.com"&gt; <a class=
"counter" id="dns-co" href="#dns"></a>
&lt;link rel="subresource"  href="/javascript/myapp.js"&gt; <a class="counter"
id="subresource-co" href="#subresource"></a>
&lt;link rel="prefetch"     href="/images/big.jpeg"&gt; <a class="counter" id=
"prefetch-co" href="#prefetch"></a>
&lt;link rel="prerender"    href="//example.org/next_page.html"&gt; <a class=
"counter" id="prerender-co" href="#prerender"></a>
</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="dns" href="#dns-co"></a>

            <p>Pre-resolve specified hostname.

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="subresource" href="#subresource-co"></a>

            <p>Prefetch critical resource found later on this page.

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="prefetch" href="#prefetch-co"></a>

            <p>Prefetch resource for this or future navigation.

          <li>
            <a class="co" id="prerender" href="#prerender-co"></a>

            <p>Prerender specified page in anticipation of next user
            destination.
          </ol>
      </div>

      <p>Each of these is a hint for a speculative optimization. The browser
      does not guarantee that it will act on it, but it may use the hint to
      optimize its loading strategy. Unfortunately, not all browsers support
      all hints (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#speculative-hints">Table&nbsp;10-2</a>), but if they don’t, then the
      hint is treated as a no-op and is harmless; make use of each of the
      techniques just shown where possible.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-EGuaivuy">
        <p>Internet Explorer 9 supports DNS pre-fetching, but calls it
        <em>prefetch</em>. In Internet Explorer 10+, <em>dns-prefetch</em> and
        <em>prefetch</em> are equivalent, resulting in a DNS pre-fetch in both
        cases.
      </div>

      <p>To most users and even web developers, the DNS, TCP, and SSL delays
      are entirely transparent and are negotiated at network layers to which
      few of us descend. And yet each of these steps is critical to the overall
      user experience, since each extra network roundtrip can add tens or
      hundreds of milliseconds of network latency. By helping the browser
      anticipate these roundtrips, we can remove these bottlenecks and deliver
      much faster and better web applications.

        <p>The HTML document is parsed incrementally by the browser, which
        means that the server can and should flush available document markup as
        frequently as possible. This enables the client to discover and begin
        fetching critical resources as soon as possible.

        <p>Google Search offers one of the best examples of the benefits of
        this technique: when a search request arrives, the server immediately
        flushes the static header of the search page prior to even analyzing
        the query. After all, why should it wait, the header is the same for
        every search page! Then, while the client is parsing the header markup,
        the search query is dispatched to the search index, and the remainder
        of the document, which includes the search results, is delivered to the
        user once the results are ready. At this point, the dynamic parts of
        the header, such as the name of the logged-in user, are filled in via
        JavaScript.
