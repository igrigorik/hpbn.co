    <p id="chapter">Performance of Wireless Networks, Chapter 8
  </header>

  <article data-type="chapter" id="OPTIMIZING_MOBILE">
    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>First off, minimizing latency through keepalive connections,
      geo-positioning your servers and data closer to the client, optimizing
      your TLS deployments, and all the other protocol optimizations we have
      covered are only more important on mobile applications, where both
      latency and throughput are always at a premium. Similarly, all the web
      application performance best practices are equally applicable. Feel free
      to flip ahead to <a data-type="xref" href=
      "/primer-on-web-performance/">Primer on Web Performance</a>; we’ll wait.

      <p>However, mobile networks also pose some new and unique requirements
      for our performance strategy. Designing applications for the mobile web
      requires careful planning and consideration of the presentation of the
      content within the constraints of the form factor of the device, the
      unique performance properties of the radio interface, and the impact on
      the battery life. The three are inextricably linked.

      <p>Perhaps because it is the easiest to control, the presentation layer,
      with topics such as responsive design, tends to receive the most
      attention. However, where most applications fall short, it is often due
      to the incorrect design assumptions about networking performance: the
      application protocols are the same, but the differences in the physical
      delivery layers impose a number of constraints that, if unaccounted for,
      will lead to slow response times, high latency variability, and
      ultimately a compromised experience for the user. To add insult to
      injury, poor networking decisions will also have an outsized negative
      impact on the battery life of the device.

      <p>There is no universal solution for these three constraints. There are
      best practices for the presentation layer, the networking, and the
      battery life performance, but frequently they are at odds; it is up to
      you and your application to find the balance in your requirements. One
      thing is for sure: simply disregarding any one of them won’t get you far.

      <p>With that in mind, we won’t elaborate too much on the presentation
      layer, as that varies with every platform and type of application—plus,
      there are plenty of existing books dedicated to this subject. But,
      regardless of the make or the operating system, the radio and battery
      constraints imposed by mobile networks are universal, and that is what we
      will focus on in this chapter.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-AEtKUR">
        <p>Throughout this chapter and especially in the following pages, the
        term "mobile application" is used in its broadest definition: all of
        our discussions on the performance of mobile networks are equally
        applicable to native applications, regardless of the platform, and
        applications running in your browser, regardless of the browser vendor.

      <h2 id="preserve-battery-power"><a href="#preserve-battery-power" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Preserve Battery Power</h2>

      <p>When it comes to mobile, conserving power is a critical concern for
      everyone involved: device manufacturers, carriers, application
      developers, and the end users of our applications. When in doubt, or
      wondering why or how certain mobile behaviors were put in place, ask a
      simple question: how does it impact or improve the battery life? In fact,
      this is a great question to ask for any and every feature in your
      application also.

      <p>Networking performance on mobile networks is inherently linked to
      battery performance. In fact, the physical layers of the radio interface
      are specifically built to optimize the battery life against the following
      constraints:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Radio use at full power can drain a full battery in a matter of
          hours.

        <li>
          <p>Radio power requirements are going up with every wireless
          generation.

        <li>
          <p>Radio is often second in power consumption only to the screen.

        <li>
          <p>Radio use has a nonlinear energy profile with respect to data
          transferred.
        </ul>

      <p>With that in mind, mobile applications should aim to minimize their
      use of the radio interface. To be clear, that is not to say that you
      should avoid using the radio entirely; after all we are building
      connected applications that rely on access to the network! However,
      because keeping the radio active is so expensive in terms of battery
      life, our applications should maximize the amount of transferred data
      while the radio is on and then seek to minimize the number of additional
      data transfers.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-pRt2hESO">
        <p>Even though WiFi uses a radio interface to transfer data, it is
        important to realize that the underlying mechanics of WiFi, and
        consequently the latency, throughput, and power profiles of WiFi, when
        compared with 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks are fundamentally
        different; see our earlier discussion on <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/mobile-networks/#3g-4g-and-wifi-power-requirements">3G, 4G, and WiFi
        Power Requirements</a>. Consequently, the networking behavior can and
        often should be different when on WiFi vs. mobile networks.

        class="anchor">§</a>Measuring Energy Use with AT&amp;T Application
        Resource Optimizer</h4>

        <p>Despite the high emphasis on optimizing energy use, most platforms
        currently lack the necessary tools to help developers measure and
        optimize their applications. Thankfully, there are third-party tools
        that can help, such as the free Application Resource Optimizer (ARO)
        toolkit developed by AT&amp;T.

        <figure id="att-aro">
          <img src="/assets/diagrams/37d7e7aded91fc715d7acdefb738793b.png" alt=

            Resource Optimizer
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>ARO consists of two components: a collector and an analyzer. The
        collector is an Android application that runs in the background (on a
        real phone, or within an emulator) and captures the transferred data
        packets, radio activity, and other interactions with the phone. To
        capture a trace, load the collector, hit Record, interact with your
        application, and then copy the trace to your system.

        <p>Once a trace is available, you can open it with the analyzer to get
        insights into radio states, energy consumption, and traffic patterns of
        your application. One of the great features about the analyzer is that
        it will also provide recommendations for common performance pitfalls,
        such as missing compression, redundant data transfers, and more.

        <p>Two important things to note: the battery consumption and radio
        states are generated via a specified model of the device and the type
        of radio network. In other words, the generated numbers are not exact
        measurements from the device in use but estimates based on specified
        parameters in the model. On the upside, this allows you to import
        different device and network models and compare their energy use—e.g.,
        3G vs. 4G.

        <p>Finally, the collector is Android only, but the ARO analyzer can
        also accept any regular packet trace (pcap) file produced by
        <code>tcpdump</code> or a compatible tool; iOS users will have to use
        the <code>tcpdump</code> method.

      <h2 id="eliminate-periodic-and-inefficient-data-transfers"><a href=
      "#eliminate-periodic-and-inefficient-data-transfers" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Eliminate Periodic and Inefficient Data Transfers</h2>

      <p>The fact that the mobile radio incurs a fixed power cost to cycle into
      the full power state, regardless of the amount of data to be transferred,
      tells us that there is no such thing as a "small request" as far as the
      battery is concerned. Intermittent network access is a performance
      anti-pattern on mobile networks; see <a data-type="xref" href=
      "/mobile-networks/#inefficiency-of-periodic-transfers">Inefficiency of
      Periodic Transfers</a>. In fact, extending this same logic yields the
      following rules:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Polling is exceptionally expensive on mobile networks; minimize
          it.

        <li>
          <p>Where possible, push delivery and notifications should be used.

        <li>
          <p>Outbound and inbound requests should be coalesced and aggregated.

        <li>
          <p>Noncritical requests should be deferred until the radio is active.
        </ul>

      <p>In general, push delivery is more efficient than polling. However, a
      high-frequency push stream can be just as, if not more, expensive.
      Whenever there is a need for real-time updates, you should consider the
      following questions:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>What is the best interval of updates and does it match user
          expectations?

        <li>
          <p>Instead of a fixed update interval, can an adaptive strategy be
          used?

        <li>
          <p>Can the inbound or outbound requests be aggregated into fewer
          network calls?

        <li>
          <p>Can the inbound or outbound requests be deferred until later?
        </ul>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-7etyh0CD">
        <p>For push delivery, native applications have access to
        platform-specific push delivery services, which should be used when
        possible. For web applications, server-sent events (SSEs) and WebSocket
        delivery can be used to minimize latency and protocol overhead. Avoid
        polling and costly XHR techniques when possible.
      </div>

      <p>A simple aggregation strategy of bundling multiple notifications into
      a single push event, based on an adaptive interval, user preference, or
      even the battery level on the device, can make a significant improvement
      to the power profile of any application, especially background
      applications, which often rely on this type of network access pattern.

      <aside>
        <h4 id="nagle-and-efficient-server-push"><a href=
        "#nagle-and-efficient-server-push" class="anchor">§</a>Nagle and
        Efficient Server Push</h4>

        <p>TCP aficionados will undoubtedly recognize the request aggregation
        and bundling advice as Nagle’s algorithm, except reimplemented at the
        application layer! Nagle’s algorithm attempts to combine multiple small
        TCP messages into a single packet to reduce protocol overhead and the
        number of packets on the wire. Not surprisingly, our mobile
        applications can benefit a great deal from leveraging the same
        technique.

        <p>A simple implementation of such a strategy is to aggregate messages
        on the server by time, count, or size, instead of triggering an
        individual push for each one. A more involved, but significantly more
        efficient, strategy is to push updates only when the radio is already
        active on the client—e.g., defer the messages until the client
        initiates a request or leverage a third-party service that is aware of
        the client’s radio state.

        <p>For example, services such as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for
        Android and Chrome offer message delivery APIs which can aggregate
        messages and deliver updates only when the device is active: the server
        pushes its messages to GCM, and GCM determines the optimal delivery
        schedule.

        <p>Unfortunately, today there is no cross-browser API to deliver a
        GCM-like experience to all clients. However, the W3C Push API (see
        <em><a class="orm:hideurl" href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/">http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/</a></em>)
        should address this use case in the future.
      </aside>

      <p>Intermittent beacon requests such as audience measurement pings and
      real-time analytics can easily negate all of your careful battery
      optimizations. These pings are mostly harmless on wired and even WiFi
      networks but carry an outsized cost on mobile networks. Do these beacons
      need to happen instantaneously? There is a good chance that you can
      easily log and defer these requests until next time the radio is active.
      Piggyback your background pings, and pay close attention to the network
      access patterns of third-party libraries and snippets in your code.

      <p>Finally, while we have so far focused on the battery, intermittent
      network access required for techniques such as progressive enhancement
      and incremental loading also carries a large latency cost due to the RRC
      state transitions! Recall that every state transition incurs a high
      control-plane latency cost in mobile networks, which may inject hundreds
      or thousands of extra milliseconds of latency—an especially expensive
      proposition for user-initiated and interactive traffic.

      <aside>
        <h4 id="calculating-the-energy-cost-of-background-updates"><a href=
        "#calculating-the-energy-cost-of-background-updates" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Calculating the Energy Cost of Background Updates</h4>

        <p>To illustrate the impact of periodic polling on battery life, let’s
        do some simple math. The numbers are not exact but are within range of
        a typical 3G/4G mobile handset:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>5 watt-hours, or 18,000 joules of battery capacity (<img src=
            "/assets/equations/3c920a91865a3a797bfed353b70448f9.svg" class=
            "equation">)

          <li>
            <p>10 joules of consumed energy to cycle radio from idle to
            connected and back

          <li>
            <p>1 minute polling interval consumes 600 joules of energy per hour
            (<img src="/assets/equations/d9552b4fd523ec32e5b830d016cc9c56.svg"
            class="equation">)

          <li>
            <p>600 joules of energy is ~3% of total battery capacity (<img src=
            "/assets/equations/376a4471fad32292e6d2c8b8df0f1fdd.svg" class=
            "equation">)
          </ul>

        <p>~3% of available battery capacity per hour for a single application!
        All it would take is a couple of applications with non-overlapping
        polling intervals to drain your battery by midday. Although, to be
        fair, a push application with frequent, unbuffered updates can have an
        even higher energy consumption profile.

        <p>Battery life optimization and frequency of updates are inherently at
        odds. Consider the requirements of your specific application to
        determine the optimal strategy: bundling of updates, adaptive update
        intervals, pull vs. push, and so on. Then, measure the impact with ARO
        or a similar tool and adjust accordingly.

        "#eliminate-unnecessary-application-keepalives" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Eliminate Unnecessary Application Keepalives</h3>

        <p>The connection state and the lifecycle of any TCP or UDP connection
        is independent of the radio state on the device: the radio can be in a
        low-power state while the connections are maintained by the carrier
        network. Then, when a new packet arrives from the external network, the
        carrier radio network will notify the device, promote its radio to a
        connected state, and resume the data transfer.

        <p>The application does not need to keep the radio "active" to ensure
        that connections are not dropped. Unnecessary application keepalives
        can have an enormous negative impact on battery life performance and
        are often put in place due to simple misunderstanding of how the mobile
        radio works. Refer to <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/mobile-networks/#physical-layer-vs-application-layer-connectivity">Physical
        Layer vs. Application Layer Connectivity</a> and <a data-type="xref"

        <div data-type="note" id="id-04tpT5flCj">
          <p>Most mobile carriers set a 5–30 minute NAT connection timeout.
          Hence, you may need a periodic (5 minute) keepalive to keep an idle
          connection from being dropped. If you find yourself requiring more
          frequent keepalives, check your own server, proxy, and load balancer
          configuration first!

      Network Latency Overhead</h2>

      <p>A single HTTP request for a required resource may incur anywhere from
      hundreds to thousands of milliseconds of network latency overhead in a
      mobile network. In part, this is due to the high roundtrip latencies, but
      we also can’t forget the overhead (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "#http-latency-components">Figure&nbsp;8-2</a>) of DNS, TCP, TLS, and
      control-plane costs!

      <p>In the best case, the radio is already in a high-power state, the DNS
      is pre-resolved, and an existing TCP connection is available: the client
      may be able to reuse an existing connection and avoid the overhead of
      establishing a new connection. However, if the connection is busy, or
      nonexistent, then we must incur a number of additional roundtrips before
      any application data can be sent.

      <p>To illustrate the impact of these extra network roundtrips, let’s
      assume an optimistic 100 ms roundtrip time for 4G and a 200 ms roundtrip
      time for 3.5G+ networks:

      <p>The RRC control-plane latency alone can add anywhere from hundreds to
      thousands of milliseconds of overhead to reestablish the radio context on
      a 3G network! Once the radio is active, we may need to resolve the
      hostname to an IP address and then perform the TCP handshake—two network
      roundtrips. Then, if a secure tunnel is required, we may need up to two
      extra network roundtrips (see <a data-type="xref" href=
      "/transport-layer-security-tls/#tls-session-resumption">TLS Session
      Resumption</a>). Finally, the HTTP request can be sent, which adds a
      minimum of another roundtrip.

      <p>We have not accounted for the server response time or the size of the
      response, which may require several roundtrips, and yet we have already
      incurred up to half a dozen roundtrips. Multiply that by the roundtrip
      time, and we are looking at entire seconds of latency overhead for 3G,
      and roughly half a second for 4G networks.

        <h3 id="account-for-rrc-state-transitions"><a href=
        "#account-for-rrc-state-transitions" class="anchor">§</a>Account for
        RRC State Transitions</h3>

        <p>If the mobile device has been idle for more than a few seconds, you
        should assume and anticipate that the first packet will incur hundreds,
        or even thousands of milliseconds of extra RRC latency. As a rule of
        thumb, add 100 ms for 4G, 150–500 ms for 3.5G+, and 500–2,500 ms for 3G
        networks, as a one-time, control-plane latency cost.

        <p>The RRC is specifically designed to help mitigate some of the cost
        of operating the power-hungry radio. However, what we gain in battery
        life is offset by increases in latency and lower throughput due to the
        presence of the various timers, counters, and the consequent overhead
        of required network negotiation to transition between the different
        radio states. However, the RRC is also a fact of life on mobile
        networks–there is no way around it–and if you want to build optimized
        applications for the mobile web, you must design with the RRC in mind.

        <p>A quick summary of what we have learned about the RRC:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>RRC state machines are different for every wireless standard.

          <li>
            <p>RRC state machines are managed by the radio network for each
            device.

          <li>
            <p>RRC state promotions to high power occur when data must be
            transferred.

          <li>
            <p>RRC state demotions to lower power occur on network-configured
            timeouts.

          <li>
            <p>(4G) LTE state transitions can take 10 to 100 milliseconds.

          <li>
            <p>(4G) HSPA+ state transitions are competitive with LTE.

          <li>
            <p>(3G) HSPA and CDMA state transitions can take several seconds.

          <li>
            <p>Every network transfer, no matter the size, incurs an energy
            tail.
          </ul>

        <p>We have already covered why preserving battery is such an important
        goal for mobile applications, and we have also highlighted the
        inefficiency of intermittent transfers, which are a direct result of
        the timeout-driven RRC state transitions. However, there is one more
        thing you need to take away: if the device radio has been idle, then
        initiating a new data transfer on mobile networks will incur an
        additional latency delay, which may take anywhere from 100 milliseconds
        on latest-generation networks to up to several seconds on older 3G and
        2G networks.

        <p>While the network presents the illusion of an always-on experience
        to our applications, the physical or the radio layer controlled by the
        RRC is continuously connecting and disconnecting. On the surface, this
        is not an issue, but the delays imposed by the RRC are, in fact, often
        easily noticeable by many users when unaccounted for.

        Communication</h3>

        <p>A well-designed application can <em>feel fast</em> by providing
        instant feedback even if the underlying connection is slow or the
        request is taking a long time to complete. Do not couple user
        interactions, user feedback, and network communication. To deliver the
        best experience, the application should acknowledge user input within
        hundreds of milliseconds; see <a data-type="xref" href=
        "/primer-on-web-performance/#speed-performance-and-human-perception">Speed,
        Performance, and Human Perception</a>.

        <p>If a network request is required, then initiate it in the
        background, and provide immediate UI feedback to acknowledge user
        input. The control plane latency alone will often push your application
        over the allotted budget for providing instant user feedback. Plan for
        high latencies—you cannot "fix" the latency imposed by the core network
        and the RRC—and work with your design team to ensure that they are
        aware of these limitations when designing the application.

      "#design-for-variable-network-interface-availability" class=
      "anchor">§</a>Design for Variable Network Interface Availability</h2>

      <p>Users dislike slow applications, but broken applications, due to
      transient network errors, are the worst experience of all. Your mobile
      application must be robust in the face of common networking failures:
      unreachable hosts, sudden drops in throughput or increases in latency, or
      outright loss of connectivity. Unlike the tethered world, you simply
      cannot assume that once the connection is established, it will remain
      established. The user may be on the move and may enter an area with high
      amounts of interference, many active users, or plain poor coverage.

      <p>Further, just as you cannot design your pages just for the latest
      browsers, you cannot design your application just for the
      latest-generation mobile networks. As we have covered earlier
      (<a data-type="xref" href=
      "/mobile-networks/#building-for-the-multigeneration-future">Building for
      the Multigeneration Future</a>), even users with the latest handsets will
      continuously transition between 4G, 3G, and even 2G networks based on the
      continuously changing conditions of their radio environments. Your
      application should subscribe to these interface transitions and adjust
      accordingly.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-7etwToFD">
        <p>The application can subscribe to navigator.onLine notifications to
        monitor connection status. For a good introduction, also see Paul
        Kinlan’s article on HTML5Rocks: <a href=
        "https://hpbn.co/offline">Working Off the Grid with HTML5 Offline</a>.
      </div>

      <p>Change is the only constant in mobile networks. Radio channel quality
      is always changing based on distance from the tower, congestion from
      nearby users, ambient interference, and dozens of other factors. With
      that in mind, while it may be tempting to perform various forms of
      bandwidth and latency estimation to optimize your mobile application, the
      results should be treated, at best, as transient data points.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-avtgh9FG">
        <p>The iPhone 4 "antennagate" serves as a great illustration of the
        unpredictable nature of radio performance: reception quality was
        affected by the physical location of your hand in regards to the
        phone’s antenna, which gave birth to the infamous "You’re holding it
        wrong."
      </div>

      <p>Latency and bandwidth estimates on mobile networks are stable on the
      order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, at most a second, but not
      more. Hence, while optimizations such as adaptive bitrate streaming are
      still useful for long-lived streams, such as video, which is adapted in
      data chunks spanning a few seconds, these bandwidth estimates should
      definitely not be cached or used later to make decisions about the
      available throughput: even on 4G, you may measure your throughput as just
      a few hundred Kbit/s, and then move your radio a few inches and get
      Mbit/s+ performance!

      <aside>
        <h4 id="streaming-applications-on-mobile-networks"><a href=
        "#streaming-applications-on-mobile-networks" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Streaming Applications on Mobile Networks</h4>

        <p>Streaming applications on mobile networks are a tricky problem. If
        you need to perform a large download and have confidence that the
        entire file will be used, then you should download the entire file in
        one shot and then leave the radio idle for as long as possible—e.g.,
        the behavior of music file downloads in the Pandora application we
        covered earlier.

        <p>However, if you cannot stream the full file (e.g., an HD video) due
        to size or user behavior constraints, then you should leverage adaptive
        bitrate streaming to continuously adjust to changes in network
        throughput. You <em>will</em> incur high battery cost, but at least you
        will deliver the best user experience while doing so! Alternatively,
        consider prompting the user to switch to WiFi.
      </aside>

      <p>End-to-end bandwidth and latency estimation is a hard problem on any
      network, but doubly so on mobile networks. Avoid it, because you will get
      it wrong. Instead, use coarse-grained information about the generation of
      the network, and adjust your code accordingly. To be clear, knowing the
      generation or type of mobile network does not make any end-to-end
      performance guarantees, but it does tell you important data about the
      latency of the first wireless hop and the end-to-end performance of the
      carrier network; see <a data-type="xref" href=
      "/mobile-networks/#latency-and-jitter-in-mobile-networks">Latency and
      Jitter in Mobile Networks</a> and <a data-type="xref" href=
      "/mobile-networks/#hspa-to-lte-advanced">Table&nbsp;7-6</a>.

      <p>Finally, throughput and latency aside, you should plan for loss of
      connectivity: assume this case is not an exception but the rule. Your
      application should remain operational, to the extent possible, when the
      network is unavailable or a transient failure happens and should adapt
      based on request type and specific error:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Do not cache or attempt to guess the state of the network.

        <li>
          <p>Dispatch the request, listen for failures, and diagnose what
          happened.

        <li>
          <p>Transient errors will happen; plan for them, and use a retry
          strategy.

        <li>
          <p>Listen to connection state to anticipate the best request
          strategy.

        <li>
          <p>Use a backoff algorithm for request retries; do not spin forever.

        <li>
          <p>If offline, log and dispatch the request later if possible.

        <li>
          <p>Leverage HTML5 AppCache and localStorage for offline mode.
        </ul>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-w5t9fKFQ">

      and Return to Idle</h2>

      <p>Mobile radio interface is optimized for bursty transfers, which is a
      property you should leverage whenever possible: group your requests
      together and download as much as possible, as quickly as possible, and
      then let the radio return to an idle state. This strategy will deliver
      the best network throughput and maximize battery life of the device.

      <div data-type="note" id="id-7etlcjfD">
        <p>The only accurate way to estimate the network’s speed is, well, to
        use it! Latest-generation networks, such as LTE and HSPA+, perform
        dynamic allocation of resources in one-millisecond intervals and
        prioritize bursty data flows. To go fast, keep it simple: batch and
        pre-fetch as much data as you can, and let the network do the rest.
      </div>

      <p>An important corollary is that progressive loading of resources may do
      more harm than good on mobile networks. By downloading content in small
      chunks, we expose our applications to higher variability both in
      throughput and latency, not to mention the much higher energy costs to
      operate the radio. Instead, anticipate what your users will need next,
      download the content ahead of time, and let the radio idle:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If you need to fetch a large music or a video file, consider
          downloading the entire file upfront, instead of streaming in chunks.

        <li>
          <p>Prefetch application content and invest in metrics and statistical
          models to help identify which content is appropriate to download
          ahead of time.

        <li>
          <p>Prefetch third-party content, such as ads, ahead of time and add
          application logic to show and update their state when necessary.

        <li>
          <p>Eliminate unnecessary intermittent transfers. See <a data-type=
          "xref" href=
          "/mobile-networks/#46-of-battery-consumption-to-transfer-02-of-total-bytes">
          46% of Battery Consumption to Transfer 0.2% of Total Bytes</a>.
        </ul>

        "#building-and-evaluating-a-prefetch-model" class=
        "anchor">§</a>Building and Evaluating a Prefetch Model</h4>

        <p>Content pre-fetching will <em>always</em> create a natural tension:
        on one hand, you want to download as few bytes as possible, and on the
        other you want to minimize your latency and throughput variability and
        reduce your impact on the battery. Which is more important? Wrong
        question. The answer is always contextual to your application and the
        metric you choose to use to determine the effectiveness of your
        pre-fetch strategy.

        <p>The important takeaway is that there are, at a minimum, three
        variables to balance: number of transferred bytes, impact on the
        battery, and variability in network throughput and latency. Further, as
        we saw, these variables are not exclusive: transferring a larger batch
        of bytes in a single transfer may give you better throughput.

        <p>An application with a highly predictable usage pattern can make use
        of aggressive pre-fetching, minimize battery consumption, improve user
        experience, and simultaneously avoid incurring a large byte overhead.
        Conversely, a poorly implemented pre-fetch strategy can download a lot
        of unnecessary data and hurt the overall experience for the user.

        <p>To determine how your application should behave, first determine
        your primary goals and the primary usage patterns of your application.
        Then use that data to implement a pre-fetch strategy and gather metrics
        to validate the assumptions of your model. Rinse, lather, and repeat.

      <p>Current industry estimates show that almost 90% of the worldwide
      wireless traffic is expected to originate indoors, and frequently in
      areas with WiFi connectivity within reach. Hence, while the latest 4G
      networks may compete with WiFi over peak throughput and latency, very
      frequently they still impose a monthly data cap: mobile access is metered
      and often expensive to the user. Further, WiFi connections are more

      <p>One of the great properties of the layered architecture of our network
      infrastructure is that it abstracts the physical delivery from the
      transport layer, and the transport layer abstracts the routing and data
      delivery from the application protocols. This separation provides great
      API abstractions, but for best end-to-end performance, we still need to
      consider the entire stack.

      <p>Throughout this chapter, we have focused on the unique properties of
      the physical layer of mobile networks, such as the presence of the RRC,
      concerns over the battery life of the device, and incurred routing
      latencies in mobile networks. However, on top of this physical layer
      reside the transport and session protocols we have covered in earlier
      chapters, and all of their optimizations are just as critical, perhaps
      doubly so:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a data-type="xref" href=
          "/building-blocks-of-tcp/#optimizing-for-tcp">Optimizing for TCP</a>

          "/transport-layer-security-tls/#optimizing-for-tls">Optimizing for
          TLS</a>
        </ul>

      <p>Minimizing latency by reusing keepalive connections, geo-positioning
      servers and data closer to the client, optimizing TLS deployments, and
      all the other optimizations we outlined earlier are even more important
      on mobile networks, where roundtrip latencies are high and bandwidth is
      always at a premium.

      <p>Of course, our optimization strategy does not stop with transport and
      session protocols; they are simply the foundation. From there, we must
      also consider the performance implications of different application
      protocols (HTTP/1.0, 1.1, and 2), as well as general web application best
      practices—keep reading, we are not done yet!
